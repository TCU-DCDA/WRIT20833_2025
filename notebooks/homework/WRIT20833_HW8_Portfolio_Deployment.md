# WRIT 20833 - Homework 8: Portfolio Deployment & Documentation
## When Coding Meets Culture: Going Public with Your Research

**Due**: Friday, November 15, 2025 (**HARD DEADLINE**)
**Format**: Live GitHub Pages URL + Professional Documentation
**Assessment**: Ungrading approach (see criteria below)

---

## Overview

In this final individual portfolio assignment, you'll deploy your styled website to GitHub Pages, making your research journey publicly accessible on the web. You'll also create professional documentation (README.md) and write a comprehensive reflection on your web development learning journey.

**What you'll build**: A live, publicly accessible portfolio website showcasing your "When Coding Meets Culture" research, complete with professional repository documentation.

**Why this matters**: Publishing your work publicly demonstrates confidence in your research and technical skills. Your portfolio becomes part of your professional identity—shareable on resumes, LinkedIn, and graduate school applications.

**IMPORTANT**: This is the **hard deadline** before shifting full focus to group final projects. All individual portfolio work must be complete by this date.

---

## Learning Objectives

By completing this assignment, you will:
- Deploy a static website to GitHub Pages
- Write professional technical documentation (README.md)
- Reflect critically on your web development learning journey
- Understand the relationship between local development and public deployment
- Complete a polished portfolio suitable for professional use

---

## Technical Requirements

### Prerequisites
- **Completed HW7**: Fully styled 4-page HTML/CSS portfolio

- If repository is private, click "Change visibility" → "Make public"

#### 2. Enable GitHub Pages
- In repository **Settings**, click **Pages** in left sidebar
- Under "Source", select **main** branch
- Click **Save**
- Wait 1-2 minutes for deployment
- Your site URL will appear: `https://your-username.github.io/repository-name/`

#### 3. Fix Broken Links (if needed)
If images or pages don't load after deployment:
- Check that all file paths are correct
- Use relative paths: `images/chart.png` not `/images/chart.png`
- Verify file names match exactly (case-sensitive!)

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: Site shows "404 Page Not Found"
**Solutions**:
- Wait 2-3 minutes after enabling Pages (deployment takes time)
- Check that main branch is selected in Pages settings
- Verify repository is public
- Ensure `index.html` exists (GitHub Pages needs this as homepage)

### Issue: Images don't load on live site
**Solutions**:
- Check image file paths use relative paths: `images/chart.png`
- Verify image filenames match exactly (case-sensitive!)
- Confirm images exist in repository and were pushed to GitHub
- Check `images/` folder is committed and pushed

### Issue: CSS styling doesn't appear
**Solutions**:
- Verify `<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">` exists in all HTML files
- Check `style.css` filename matches exactly (case-sensitive)
- Confirm `style.css` is committed and pushed to GitHub
- Clear browser cache and refresh

### Issue: Navigation links broken
**Solutions**:
- Use relative links: `<a href="data.html">` not `<a href="/data.html">`
- Verify HTML filenames match link hrefs exactly
- Test links locally in Live Server before deploying

### Issue: Site works locally but not on GitHub Pages
**Solutions**:
- This usually indicates file path issues
- Use only relative paths (no leading `/`)
- Check for case sensitivity in filenames
- Commit and push all files to GitHub

## Markdown Basics for README

Markdown is a simple formatting language. Here are essentials:

```markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3

**Bold text**
*Italic text*

- Bullet point
- Another bullet

1. Numbered list
2. Second item

[Link text](https://url.com)

`inline code`

\`\`\`
code block
\`\`\`
```

**Preview markdown in VS Code**: Right-click `README.md` → "Open Preview"

## Tips for Success

### Deployment Tips
- **Test thoroughly locally first**: Fix all issues before deploying
- **Commit and push everything**: GitHub Pages only shows pushed commits
- **Be patient**: Deployment isn't instant (wait 2-3 minutes)
- **Check live site carefully**: What works locally might break in deployment

### Documentation Tips
- **Write for strangers**: Assume readers know nothing about your project
- **Be professional**: This README represents you publicly
- **Include essentials**: Project overview, live link, and author info are critical
- **Use markdown formatting**: Headers, lists, and links make README readable

### Reflection Tips
- **Be specific**: Use concrete examples from your experience
- **Show growth**: Highlight what you learned, not just what you did
- **Connect to course themes**: Reference "When Coding Meets Culture" throughout
- **Be honest**: Discuss real challenges and how you overcame them

### Time Management
- **Don't wait until deadline**: Deployment can have unexpected issues
- **Start with deployment**: Get site live first, then write documentation
- **Save reflection for last**: You'll have more perspective after deployment
- **Build in buffer time**: Allow extra time for troubleshooting

## Assessment Philosophy: Earned Insight Over Clean Code

Our ungrading approach prioritizes:
- **Successful deployment** over perfect code
- **Thoughtful reflection** over technical perfection
- **Complete documentation** over advanced features
- **Learning demonstrated** over flawless execution

Your portfolio doesn't need to be perfect—it needs to be **yours, public, and polished enough to share proudly**. You'll receive narrative feedback celebrating your growth and identifying areas for continued development, not a numerical grade.

---

## Questions?

If you're stuck:
1. Review Session 13, 14 notes and demonstrations
2. Check GitHub Pages documentation
3. Use Session 14 hands-on time for live troubleshooting
4. Post specific error messages in class forum
5. Attend office hours (especially important this week!)
6. Ask classmates—deployment issues are often solved collaboratively

**Remember**: Everyone faces deployment challenges. Asking for help is expected and encouraged!

---

## Final Thoughts

Congratulations on building and deploying your first web portfolio! This is a significant accomplishment—you've gone from zero web development experience to having a live, public website showcasing computational humanities research.

Your portfolio demonstrates:
- ✅ **Technical skills**: HTML, CSS, version control, deployment
- ✅ **Research skills**: Data collection, analysis, interpretation
- ✅ **Communication skills**: Presenting complex work to public audiences
- ✅ **Growth mindset**: Learning new tools and embracing challenges

This portfolio is yours to keep, share, and build upon. You've earned it!

---

*This is the final individual portfolio assignment in the "When Coding Meets Culture" sequence. After HW8, you'll apply these skills to collaborative group final projects, demonstrating how computational methods and humanities interpretation work together to develop data-driven cultural insights.*

**Good luck, and we look forward to seeing your portfolios live on the web! 🚀**
