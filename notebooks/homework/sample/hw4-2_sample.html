<h2>Assignment Overview</h2>
<p>You'll now use topic modeling to uncover hidden patterns in your dataset and reflect on your complete analytical journey. This assignment builds directly on your Pre-Project Prep 4.1 work.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Step 5: Reconnecting with Your Predictions</h2>
<h3>Before You Begin</h3>
<p><strong>Review your predictions from 4.1</strong>: Look back at what you predicted about deeper topics and themes. Write down 2-3 specific topic predictions you made.</p>
<p><strong>Current state of knowledge</strong>: After term frequency and sentiment analysis, how has your understanding of your dataset evolved? What do you now think topic modeling might reveal?</p>
<hr>
<h2>Step 6: Topic Modeling</h2>
<p><em>Analyzed Data to Insight</em></p>
<h3>Technical Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>Primary Tool: Gensim LDA</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We'll demonstrate this Python-native tool in class</li>
<li>Integrates well with pandas and produces interpretable results</li>
<li><em>Alternatives: scikit-learn's LatentDirichletAllocation or MALLET (if you're comfortable with additional setup)</em></li>
</ul>
<h3>Technical Checkpoint 4: Gensim Data Prep</h3>

<pre><code># Checkpoint 4: Prepare for topic modeling
print(f"Number of documents: {len(your_texts)}")
print(f"Vocabulary size: {len(your_dictionary)}")
print(f"Average document length: {np.mean([len(doc) for doc in your_tokenized_docs])}")
# If avg length &lt; 10 words or vocab &lt; 100, may need to reconsider preprocessing</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<h3>Deliverable for Step 6</h3>
<p><strong>Write 2 paragraphs:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Prediction vs. Reality</strong>: How did your topic modeling results compare to your specific predictions from Step 4? What topics emerged that you hadn't expected?</li>
<li><strong>Model Assessment</strong>: Look at 4-5 documents and their topic assignments. Do the assigned topics make sense when you read the full text? Where would you disagree with the model?</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2>Step 7: Integration and Reflection</h2>
<p><em>Insight to Knowledge (and glimpsing Wisdom)</em></p>
<h3>Part A: Method and Tool Assessment (2 paragraphs)</h3>
<p><strong>Evolution of Understanding</strong>: How did your understanding change from your initial predictions through term frequency, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling? Where were you most wrong, and what did those surprises teach you?</p>
<p><strong>Analytical Methods</strong>: Which analytical method (term frequency, sentiment analysis, or topic modeling) was most revealing for your dataset? What did you learn about what these tools can and cannot tell you?</p>
<h3>Part B: Humanities Perspective (1-2 paragraphs)</h3>
<p><strong>Computational vs. Traditional Analysis</strong>: How does this data-driven approach compare to how you might traditionally analyze texts in humanities courses? Consider how this process helps you avoid the trap of cherry-picking evidence to support predetermined conclusions. What are the advantages and limitations of automated analysis?</p>
<h3>Part C: Personal Learning (1 paragraph)</h3>
<p><strong>Your Analytical Growth</strong>: What did this process teach you about forming and testing hypotheses? How has your relationship to evidence and conclusions evolved?</p>

<h2>Submission Requirements</h2>
<p>Submit to your Pre-Project Practice Files dropbox:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Updated Jupyter Notebook</strong> (<code>LASTNAME_HW4-2_F25.ipynb</code>) containing Steps 1-7</li>
<li><strong>Any new visualization PNG files</strong> (if not embedded in notebook)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Due Date</strong>: October 13th</p>

<h2>Grading Philosophy</h2>
<p>This assignment prioritizes <strong>earned insight over clean code</strong>. You'll be evaluated on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Depth of reflection</strong> and willingness to be surprised by your data</li>
<li><strong>Evolution of thinking</strong> from initial predictions through final analysis</li>
<li><strong>Critical assessment</strong> of both your results and your analytical tools</li>
<li><strong>Integration</strong> of technical analysis with humanistic interpretation</li>
</ul>
<p>Technical execution matters, but intellectual growth and genuine insight are the primary goals. The best submissions will show students whose understanding deepened and changed through engagement with their data.</p>
