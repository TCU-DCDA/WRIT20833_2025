    "# Found Data & Pandas Fundamentals\n",
    "## Your First Steps into Cultural Data Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the exciting world of **found data** - information that already exists in the world, waiting to be discovered and analyzed! Today we'll explore how to work with cultural datasets using Python's most powerful data analysis tool: **pandas**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📚 How This Lesson Works:\n",
    "This is a **demonstration and learning notebook**. We'll walk through pandas fundamentals using example datasets and guided practice. \n",
    "\n",
    "**🎯 Ready to practice with your own data?** After this lesson, use the companion **Student Practice Notebook**:\n",
    "- **📝 `WRIT20833_Found_Data_Student_Practice_F25.ipynb`** (in the homework folder)\n",
    "- Apply these skills to your own cultural dataset\n",
    "- Complete guided exercises and reflection questions\n",
    "- Submit your analysis for assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is \"Found Data\"?\n",
    "Found data includes:\n",
    "- **Public datasets** from sites like Kaggle, government databases, or academic repositories\n",
    "- **Scraped data** collected from websites (when ethically and legally permissible)\n",
    "- **Digital collections** from libraries, museums, and cultural institutions\n",
    "- **Social media data** and other user-generated content\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of data offers incredible opportunities for cultural analysis, but it comes with important ethical considerations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📝 What Makes Data Good for Pandas Analysis?\n",
    "**For this lesson, you'll want datasets that include:**\n",
    "- **Rich text data**: Names, titles, descriptions, categories, locations\n",
    "- **Mixed data types**: Combination of text, numbers, dates, and categories\n",
    "- **Some numeric columns**: For calculations, filtering, and visualization\n",
    "- **Categorical information**: Genres, types, classifications that can be grouped and compared\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples of ideal cultural datasets:**\n",
    "- Movie/book databases with titles, genres, years, ratings\n",
    "- Museum collections with artist names, artwork titles, dates, mediums\n",
    "- Music datasets with song titles, artists, albums, genres, duration\n",
    "- Historical records with names, places, dates, events"

    "## Part 1: Understanding Found Data & Data Collection Ethics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Found Data: Where Culture Lives in Data Form\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Found data\" refers to datasets that already exist and can be discovered, rather than data you collect yourself through surveys or experiments. For cultural analysis, found data is everywhere:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Major Sources of Cultural Found Data:**\n",
    "- **Kaggle** (kaggle.com): Thousands of datasets on everything from movie ratings to historical census data\n",
    "- **Government Open Data**: Census data, cultural funding records, historical immigration data\n",
    "- **Institutional Repositories**: Museum collections, library catalogs, university digital archives\n",
    "- **APIs**: Twitter, Instagram, YouTube (for contemporary cultural analysis)\n",
    "- **Scraped Data**: Information extracted from websites using tools like browser extensions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Web Scraping and Browser Extensions\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes the data you need isn't available as a download - it's displayed on websites. **Browser extensions** like \"Instant Data Scraper\" can help extract data from web pages into spreadsheet format. However, this power comes with important responsibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding robots.txt: The Web's Ethical Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "Before scraping any website, you should check its **robots.txt** file - a text file that tells automated programs (like scrapers) what they're allowed to access.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How to check robots.txt:**\n",
    "Add `/robots.txt` to any website's main URL:\n",
    "- `https://example.com/robots.txt`\n",
    "- `https://archive.org/robots.txt`\n",
    "- `https://www.nytimes.com/robots.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "**What robots.txt tells us:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "User-agent: *          # Rules for all bots\n",
    "Disallow: /private/    # Don't access this directory\n",
    "Allow: /public/        # This area is okay\n",
    "Crawl-delay: 10        # Wait 10 seconds between requests\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Robots.txt in the Age of AI and LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT has sparked new debates about robots.txt:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Traditional robots.txt** was designed for search engines and researchers doing small-scale scraping.\n",
    "\n",
    "**AI training concerns**: Many websites now worry about their content being scraped to train commercial AI models without compensation or attribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**New considerations**:\n",
    "- Some sites are updating robots.txt to specifically block AI training bots\n",
    "- Legal questions about whether robots.txt applies to AI training data collection\n",
    "- Ethical debates about consent, fair use, and intellectual property\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best practices for cultural researchers**:\n",
    "1. Always check and respect robots.txt\n",
    "2. Consider the scale and purpose of your data collection\n",
    "3. Give attribution to data sources\n",
    "4. When in doubt, contact the website owner\n",
    "5. Be transparent about your research methods\n",
