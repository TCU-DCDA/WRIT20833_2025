    "\n",
    "**Technical Tips**:\n",
    "- Add domain-specific stopwords for your dataset\n",
    "- Try num_topics between 3-7 and choose the most interpretable\n",
    "- Increase passes to 15-20 for better results\n",
    "- Save your best model so you don't have to retrain\n",
    "\n",
    "**Critical Thinking Tips**:\n",
    "- Topics are statistical patterns, not guaranteed cultural themes\n",
    "- YOU must validate whether word clusters are meaningful\n",
    "- Read individual documents to verify topic assignments\n",
    "- Some texts (irony, mixed themes) will challenge the algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "**Research Process Tips**:\n",
    "- Form predictions before running the model\n",
    "- Document surprises and unexpected findings\n",
    "- Compare across all three analytical methods\n",
    "- Discuss limitations honestly in your reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember**: Being surprised by what topics emerge is a sign of genuine discovery, not analytical failure. The best insights come when data challenges our assumptions!"

    "\n",
    "Throughout this analysis, you've engaged with fundamental questions about **how code categorizes culture**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Who decides what counts as a coherent \"topic\"?** The algorithm clusters words statistically, but YOU decide if those clusters represent meaningful cultural themes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What cultural knowledge is embedded in our choices?** Stopword lists, preprocessing decisions, and topic labels all require human judgment shaped by our cultural positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **How do algorithmic categories relate to human understanding?** LDA finds word co-occurrence patterns. Whether those patterns map onto actual cultural themes requires humanistic interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What gets lost in computational reading?** Irony, coded language, contextual nuance—the algorithm's \"bag of words\" approach misses what makes cultural texts meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "These aren't just technical questions—they're about **power, interpretation, and how computational tools shape our understanding of culture**. Topic modeling is powerful for pattern detection, but it's your humanistic expertise that transforms those patterns into cultural insight."
