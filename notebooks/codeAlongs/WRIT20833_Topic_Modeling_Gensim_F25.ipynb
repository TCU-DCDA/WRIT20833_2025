    "- **Understand topic modeling** as a distant reading technique\n",
    "- **Install and use Gensim LDA** for discovering hidden topics\n",
    "- **Preprocess text** appropriately for topic modeling (different from sentiment analysis!)\n",
    "- **Interpret topic word lists** and assign meaningful labels\n",
    "- **Think critically** about algorithmic theme detection\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔗 Connection to Your Work:\n",
    "This prepares you for **HW4-2**, where you'll apply topic modeling to your own dataset and integrate findings with your HW4-1 term frequency and sentiment analysis."
