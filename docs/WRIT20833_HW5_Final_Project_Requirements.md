# When Coding Meets Culture: Developing Data-Driven Opinions
## WRIT 20833 Final Project Requirements

*This project builds on your approved HW5 proposal and the complete text analysis workflow you developed across HW4-1 and HW4-2.*

## Project Overview

For your final project (groups of up to 3 members or individual work), you will execute the digital research project outlined in your HW5 proposal. Your project explores what happens when coding meets culture, providing a test case for your answer to this question: **What insights emerge when we integrate term frequency analysis, sentiment analysis, and topic modeling with traditional humanities interpretation methods?** What do computational and humanities approaches reveal together that neither could discover alone? How do you move from initial assumptions to well-grounded, data-driven opinions?

This assignment combines the technical skills you have learned with your own research and career goals. Your work should employ a humanist approach to data analytics, demonstrating how computational analysis can challenge and refine cultural interpretation, using the digital humanities articles from our threaded discussions as models for your approach.

## Deliverables

Your project includes three integrated components:

1. **Research Essay** (1500-2000 words): Academic analysis of your research process, methods, and findings
2. **Python Notebooks** (.ipynb files): Complete computational analysis demonstrating your three base methods plus additional approaches
3. **Web Portfolio** (HTML/CSS): Public-facing presentation of your research findings and insights

## Project Requirements

### Research Question & Methods
Building on your HW5 proposal, execute a research question that could not be answered using traditional humanities methods alone (close reading, reflection, etc.). Use the three base methods from HW4-1 and HW4-2 (Term Frequency Analysis, Sentiment Analysis with VADER, Topic Modeling with Gensim) plus close reading and additional computational methods as appropriate to answer your research question.

### Technical Standards
- All code must be well-documented with clear comments
- Cite all tutorials you use and any code you take from elsewhere (in comments and/or the essay)
- Notebooks should run cleanly and reproduce your results
- Web portfolio must demonstrate functional HTML/CSS skills

### Collaborative Work
If working in a group, your essay should clearly document which members contributed to each component of the project. Success depends on effective planning and task allocation.

## Assessment Components

### Research Essay
Your essay should outline the significance of your project, the methodologies you chose (and why), your research results, and your assessment of the project's success. This is an exploratory essay that documents how your research question evolved and how your methods worked (or didn't).

**Required sections:**

**Overview** (100-300 words)
Brief high-level overview of the project and how it builds on your HW4-1/HW4-2 work.

**Research Question** (200-300 words)
The question itself, background context, and how the question evolved from your HW5 proposal through project execution.

**Methods** (400-800 words)
- Why you selected your specific combination of computational and interpretive methods
- How you anticipated and addressed limitations or problems with your tools
- What sections of course materials were helpful
- Your data biography: sources, collection ethics, and preparation process

**Group Roles/Responsibilities** (300-800 words - for group projects only)
Who was responsible for each component and how the actual work distribution evolved during the project.

**Findings** (300-500 words)
- What did your integrated analysis reveal?
- How did results compare to your initial hypothesis?
- What limitations or gaps remain in your findings?
- How confident are you in your conclusions?

**Integration & Reflection** (200-300 words)
- How did your project integrate both humanities work and data analytics?
- What did computational methods reveal that close reading alone could not?
- What would you change if you repeated the project?
- What directions would you pursue with additional time?

### Python Notebooks
Your computational analysis should demonstrate:
- Clean, well-documented code that reproduces your analysis
- Effective use of all three base methods (Term Frequency, Sentiment Analysis, Topic Modeling)
- Integration of additional methods as appropriate to your research question
- Clear visualization of results and patterns

### Web Portfolio
Your public presentation should include:
- Clear, accessible presentation of computational findings to public audiences
- Integration of visualizations and analysis from your notebooks
- Demonstration of HTML/CSS technical skills
- Effective narrative structure that communicates your insights
- Professional presentation suitable for academic or career portfolios

**Public Presentation Strategy** (address in your essay, 200-300 words)
How did you design your web portfolio to communicate your findings to non-academic audiences? What choices did you make about visualization, narrative structure, and accessibility?

## Timeline & Submission

- **HW5 Proposal Due**: [Date]
- **Project Check-in**: [Date] - Brief progress report and any challenges
- **Final Project Due**: [Date] - All three components submitted
- **Class Presentations**: [Date] - Brief presentations of key findings (time permitting)

## Research Question Examples

Your question should demonstrate why computational methods are necessary:

- How do sentiment patterns in [cultural domain] reveal underlying ideological tensions that traditional literary analysis might miss?
- What topics emerge from large-scale analysis of [text corpus] that reshape our understanding of [cultural phenomenon]?
- How does the integration of term frequency, sentiment, and topic modeling create a more complete picture of [cultural debate/movement/period]?

## Success Criteria

A successful project will:
- Execute an intellectually significant research question that requires both computational and interpretive methods
- Demonstrate sophisticated use of all three base analytical methods
- Present findings effectively to both academic and public audiences
- Reflect critically on the integration of digital and traditional humanities approaches
- Show clear evolution from HW5 proposal through final execution

## Assessment Philosophy

This project prioritizes **earned insight over clean code**. You'll be evaluated on:

- **Depth of reflection** and willingness to be surprised by your data
- **Evolution of thinking** from initial predictions through final, data-driven opinions
- **Critical assessment** of both your results and your analytical tools
- **Integration** of technical analysis with humanistic interpretation

Technical execution matters, but **intellectual growth and genuine insight are the primary goals**. The best submissions will show students whose understanding deepened and changed through engagement with their data—demonstrating what happens when coding truly meets culture.

**Remember**: Being "wrong" in your initial assumptions is not failure—it's evidence of genuine learning and the foundation for developing well-grounded, data-driven opinions. The goal is not to confirm what you already thought, but to discover what emerges when computational analysis challenges cultural interpretation.

## Self-Assessment & Reflection

As part of our ungrading approach, you will engage in self-assessment throughout the project:

- **Proposal Stage**: Reflect on how your project builds meaningfully on course concepts
- **Check-in Stage**: Assess your progress and identify areas needing support
- **Final Submission**: Include a self-assessment of your learning and growth through the project

Your final project represents the culmination of your semester-long exploration of digital humanities methods. Consider how this work demonstrates your development as both a computational thinker and humanities scholar.

*Upon completing this project, you will have developed a complete digital humanities workflow suitable for inclusion in academic or professional portfolios.*
