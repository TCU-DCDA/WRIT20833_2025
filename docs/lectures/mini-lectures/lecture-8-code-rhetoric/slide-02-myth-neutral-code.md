## Slide 2 — The Myth of Neutral Code

Filename: `slide2.jpg`
Layout: Two-column (image-left)
Orientation: Portrait (3:4)
Recommended size: 800x1200px

General Style Guidelines (include in every prompt):
- Color palette: Primary Purple #9b59b6; Amber #f1c40f; Light Purple #c9a9ff; Blue #3498db; Green #2ecc71; Red #ff6b6b; Dark backgrounds #1a0330–#2d1b5e.
- Aesthetic: conceptual but clear, vertical revelation composition, annotated where helpful, sRGB, jpeg for web.
- Emphasis: show the surface technical neutrality cracking to reveal rhetorical choices; high contrast for readability.

Prompt (primary):
```
Vertical composition showing code appearing neutral but revealing hidden arguments. Top: clean, pristine code snippet in a text editor appearing objective. Middle: magnifying glass or x-ray view revealing the code's hidden rhetorical structure—what gets emphasized (large font), what gets marginalized (small text, hidden), whose voice is centered. Bottom: the same code shown with its argumentative choices made visible through annotation, highlighting, and symbols of power (scales, podiums). Use red (#ff6b6b) to indicate exclusion or problematic neutrality and green (#2ecc71) to indicate revealed truths or inclusive choices. Portrait orientation, 3:4 aspect ratio, vertical revelation from surface to depth.
```

Alternative prompt:
```
Conceptual vertical image: a neutral mask or façade at top labeled "just technical"; mask cracks in middle to reveal layers underneath—visual metaphors for value judgments (scales of justice, pointing fingers, hierarchical stacks). Bottom shows code annotated to surface rhetorical choices. Portrait orientation, unmasking narrative.
```

Notes: leave negative space for slide caption/points. Keep annotations simple and legible at 800x1200px.
