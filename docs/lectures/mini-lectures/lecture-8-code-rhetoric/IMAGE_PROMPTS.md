## Slide 1: Title/Hook
**Filename:** `slide1.jpg`
**Layout:** Full-width title slide
**Orientation:** Landscape (16:9)
**Recommended size:** 1200x675px

**Prompt:**
```
A visual metaphor showing code making arguments. Left side: HTML/CSS code displayed as text. Right side: the same code transforms into a persuasive megaphone or speech bubble with visual hierarchy, emphasis, and rhetorical power. Code symbols morph into rhetorical devices - heading tags become raised podiums, CSS font-size becomes volume controls, color becomes emotional tone. Purple (#9b59b6) code transforming into amber (#f1c40f) rhetorical symbols. Concept: code is language with persuasive intent. Landscape orientation, 16:9 aspect ratio. Modern, conceptual aesthetic.
```

**Alternative prompt:**
```
Split composition: technical HTML/CSS syntax on left rendered in monochrome/neutral. Same code on right shown as vibrant, argumentative visual design - large bold text, strategic color use, hierarchical layout. Visual bridge between code-as-technical and code-as-rhetorical. Purple and amber color scheme. Landscape orientation, horizontal transformation narrative.
```

## Slide 2: The Myth of Neutral Code
**Filename:** `slide2.jpg`
**Layout:** Two-column (image-left)
**Orientation:** Portrait (3:4)
**Recommended size:** 800x1200px

**Prompt:**
```
Vertical composition showing code appearing neutral but revealing hidden arguments. Top: clean, pristine code snippet in a text editor appearing objective. Middle: magnifying glass or x-ray view revealing the code's hidden rhetorical structure - what gets emphasized (large font), what gets marginalized (small text, hidden), whose voice is centered. Bottom: the same code shown with its argumentative choices made visible through annotation and highlighting. Red (#ff6b6b) reveals problems with neutrality claim, green (#2ecc71) shows revealed truth. Portrait orientation, 3:4 aspect ratio, vertical revelation from surface to depth.
```

**Alternative prompt:**
```
Conceptual vertical image: mask or neutral façade at top labeled "just technical." Mask cracking in middle to reveal underneath: every technical choice is a value judgment shown through symbolic imagery - scales of justice, pointing fingers, hierarchical structures. Bottom shows code as inherently rhetorical. Portrait orientation, unmasking narrative.
```

## Slide 3: Same Content, Different Arguments
**Filename:** `slide3.jpg`
**Layout:** Full-width comparison
**Orientation:** Landscape (16:9)
**Recommended size:** 1200x675px

**Prompt:**
```
Horizontal three-panel comparison showing identical content structured three different ways. Panel 1 (red #e74c3c): academic hierarchy - large expert voices, small community input, top-down structure. Panel 2 (blue #3498db): community-centered - large community voices, small academic framing, grassroots-up structure. Panel 3 (green #2ecc71): dialogic - equal-sized voices, side-by-side layout, collaborative structure. Same words/data in each but visual/structural treatment creates different arguments. Landscape orientation, 16:9 aspect ratio, clear side-by-side comparison.
```

**Alternative prompt:**
```
Three website mockups displayed as browser windows side by side, all showing same content but with dramatically different visual hierarchy, color emphasis, and spatial arrangement. First emphasizes one perspective (large/top), second emphasizes different perspective, third shows balanced approach. Visual proof that structure = argument. Landscape orientation, gallery comparison format.
```

## Slide 4: HTML as Classification
**Filename:** `slide4.jpg`
**Layout:** Two-column (image-left)
**Orientation:** Portrait (3:4)
**Recommended size:** 800x1200px

**Prompt:**
```
Vertical visualization of HTML semantic tags as classification system. Each tag shown as a labeled container or filing category: <header> at top (entrance/definition zone), <main> in center (core/primary space), <aside> to margin (secondary/peripheral space), <nav> as pathways (chosen destinations). Content flowing into these predetermined categories. Purple (#9b59b6) tags acting as organizational power structures. Arrows showing how tagging = categorizing = power to define importance. Portrait orientation, 3:4 aspect ratio, vertical hierarchy from top to bottom.
```

**Alternative prompt:**
```
Conceptual vertical image of HTML tags as sorting mechanism. Unsorted content at top, HTML semantic tags in middle acting as classification filters (like library cataloging system or bureaucratic filing), sorted and hierarchically arranged content at bottom. Shows tags don't just organize - they impose meaning through categorization. Portrait orientation, top-to-bottom sorting process.
```

## Slide 5: CSS as Visual Argument
**Filename:** `slide5.jpg`
**Layout:** Two-column (image-left)
**Orientation:** Portrait (3:4)
**Recommended size:** 800x1200px

**Prompt:**
```
Vertical composition showing CSS properties as rhetorical tools from top to bottom: 1) Font-size comparison - 48px text vs 12px text with volume/importance symbols, 2) Color choices - red (urgent) vs green (affirming) with emotional associations, 3) Position - top/visible vs hidden/invisible with power implications, 4) Whitespace - generous margins (valuable) vs cramped (disposable). Each CSS property pair labeled with its rhetorical effect. Yellow (#f1c40f) highlighting for rhetorical emphasis. Portrait orientation, 3:4 aspect ratio, vertical catalog of visual rhetoric.
```

**Alternative prompt:**
```
Vertical split showing same text content styled differently: left side with subtle, minimizing CSS (small, gray, margin-less) labeled "doesn't matter." Right side with amplifying CSS (large, bold, colorful, spacious) labeled "matters most." Visual proof that CSS choices are arguments about value and importance. Portrait orientation.
```

## Slide 6: Accessibility as Ethics
**Filename:** `slide6.jpg`
**Layout:** Two-column (image-left)
**Orientation:** Portrait (3:4)
**Recommended size:** 800x1200px

**Prompt:**
```
Vertical ethical comparison: Top half shows inaccessible code choices - missing alt text, low color contrast, desktop-only design - with barriers/walls blocking diverse users (people with disabilities, mobile users, different contexts). Bottom half shows accessible code choices - descriptive alt text, high contrast, responsive design - with open pathways welcoming all users. Blue (#3498db) for accessibility choices, red (#ff6b6b) for barriers. Concept: code access = ethical stance. Portrait orientation, 3:4 aspect ratio, vertical progression from exclusion to inclusion.
```

**Alternative prompt:**
```
Conceptual vertical image: locked door at top labeled "inaccessible code" with people unable to enter. Open, welcoming entrance at bottom labeled "accessible code" with diverse people entering freely. Between them: specific code examples (alt text, contrast, responsive design) acting as keys that open access. Portrait orientation, access as ethical architecture.
```

## Slide 7: Examples in DH
**Filename:** `slide7.jpg`
**Layout:** Full-width examples
**Orientation:** Landscape (16:9)
**Recommended size:** 1200x675px

**Prompt:**
```
Horizontal three-panel showcase of DH projects showing code rhetoric in practice: Panel 1 - Digital archive with code choices emphasizing objects over curator analysis (visual hierarchy diagram). Panel 2 - Topic modeling results with code choices about pattern vs individual text emphasis (layout choices shown). Panel 3 - Data story with code choices about narrative control vs reader agency (scroll-triggered vs always-visible). Each panel shows code decision + resulting rhetorical effect. Purple, blue, green color coding. Landscape orientation, 16:9 aspect ratio, practical applications gallery.
```

**Alternative prompt:**
```
Horizontal gallery of three digital humanities website mockups with annotations pointing out rhetorical code choices: arrows indicating "this structural choice argues X," "this styling emphasizes Y," "this layout marginalizes Z." Shows code rhetoric in real DH contexts - archives, visualizations, scholarly arguments. Landscape orientation, annotated examples format.
```

## Slide 8: Mindset Shift
**Filename:** `slide8.jpg`
**Layout:** Two-column (image-left)
**Orientation:** Portrait (3:4)
**Recommended size:** 800x1200px

**Prompt:**
```
Vertical transformation visual: Bottom third shows coder mindset - person at keyboard focused only on technical functionality, code symbols, "does it work?" questions in monochrome. Middle shows transition - awareness awakening, code symbols gaining color and meaning. Top third shows rhetorician mindset - same person now considering audience, power, ethics, arguments while coding. Code glows with rhetorical intent in purple (#9b59b6) and amber (#f1c40f). Questioning bubbles: "Who's centered? Who's excluded? What does this argue?" Concept: evolution from technical to critical coding practice. Portrait orientation, 3:4 aspect ratio, upward transformation.
```

**Alternative prompt:**
```
Vertical before/after: Bottom shows HTML/CSS code viewed through purely technical lens (neutral, functional). Top shows same code viewed through rhetorical lens (every choice highlighted with its argumentative implications - "this centers X," "this marginalizes Y," "this assumes Z"). Shift from code-as-neutral to code-as-argument. Portrait orientation, perspective transformation.
```

## General Style Guidelines

**Color Palette (consistent across all images):**
- Primary Purple: #9b59b6 (code/technical)
- Light Purple: #c9a9ff
- Blue: #3498db (accessibility/ethics)
- Green: #2ecc71 (inclusive/good practice)
- Red: #ff6b6b (exclusion/problems)
- Yellow/Amber: #f1c40f (rhetoric/emphasis)
- Dark Background: #1a0330 to #2d1b5e

**Aesthetic Principles:**
- Conceptual but clear
- Shows code as argumentative, not neutral
- Reveals hidden rhetorical dimensions
- Critical and questioning
- Connects technical to ethical
- Shows power dynamics in structure
- Emphasizes choice and consequence
- Bridge between code and rhetoric

**Thematic Emphasis:**
- Every technical choice is rhetorical
- Structure = argument about importance
- Styling = claims about value
- Access = ethical stance
- Code makes invisible arguments visible
- Neutrality is a myth
- Awareness enables critical practice

**Technical Requirements:**
- **Slides 1, 3, 7:** Landscape orientation (16:9), size 1200x675px
- **Slides 2, 4, 5, 6, 8:** Portrait orientation (3:4), size 800x1200px
- JPEG format for web optimization (target <200KB)
- sRGB color space for web
- High contrast for readability
- Clear conceptual metaphors
- Shows transformation/revelation
- Annotated when helpful

## Slide-Specific Notes

**Slide 1**: Establish core metaphor - code is rhetorical language, not neutral tool.

**Slide 2**: Unmask the myth of neutrality. Show hidden arguments beneath technical surface.

**Slide 3**: Concrete proof - same content, different structures = different claims.

**Slide 4**: HTML tags as classification system. Shows organizational power.

**Slide 5**: CSS properties as rhetorical tools. Visual choices = value arguments.

**Slide 6**: Accessibility as ethical imperative. Code opens or closes access.

**Slide 7**: Real DH examples showing code rhetoric in practice.

**Slide 8**: Mindset transformation - from coder to critical rhetorician.

## Bridge Lecture Visual Strategy

This is a **conceptual bridge** lecture, so visuals should:
1. **Reveal hidden dimensions** - make invisible rhetoric visible
2. **Show transformation** - from neutral to argumentative framing
3. **Use metaphor effectively** - abstract concepts need visual anchors
4. **Connect technical to humanistic** - bridge two ways of thinking
5. **Prepare for instruction** - set up critical mindset before HTML/CSS teaching

Color coding:
- **Purple** = code/technical domain
- **Amber** = rhetoric/argument domain
- **Red** = problems/exclusions
- **Green** = inclusive/ethical choices
- **Blue** = access/ethics
