## Slide 1 — Title / Hook

Filename: `slide1.jpg`
Layout: Full-width title slide
Orientation: Landscape (16:9)
Recommended size: 1200x675px

General Style Guidelines (include in every prompt):
- Color palette: Primary Purple #9b59b6 (code/technical); Amber #f1c40f (rhetoric/emphasis); Light Purple #c9a9ff; Blue #3498db; Green #2ecc71; Red #ff6b6b; Dark backgrounds #1a0330–#2d1b5e.
- Aesthetic: conceptual but clear, modern, high-contrast, sRGB, JPEG optimized for web.
- Emphasis: show code as argumentative; reveal rhetorical intent; annotate when helpful; keep metaphors legible at slide scale.

Prompt (generator-friendly — primary):
```
Conceptual landscape split image: left side shows "code" represented by abstract tokens and icons (lines of small, uniform glyph tiles, angle-bracket icons, chip-like blocks, and simple code-symbol icons) arranged in a neutral monochrome grid. Right side shows those same tokenized elements reorganized into rhetorical visual metaphors — a megaphone composed of tiles, a bold speech bubble built from the glyph blocks, and podium-like shapes formed from stacked tokens. Use Primary Purple (#9b59b6) for the technical/token side and Amber (#f1c40f) accents for the rhetorical/argument side; include a soft gradient bridge between them. Keep composition simple and iconic rather than literal text. Landscape orientation, 16:9 aspect ratio, clear negative space in center for a title overlay, high contrast for legibility.
```

Alternative prompt (concise):
```
Split composition: left: abstract code tokens (iconography, glyph tiles, small brackets, chip symbols) in muted purple/gray; right: same tokens recomposed into a persuasive visual (megaphone, speech bubble, podium silhouettes) with amber highlights. Focus on symbols and shapes rather than readable text. Landscape format.
```

Notes: avoid long, readable code snippets. Favor icons, glyphs, tiles, and shapes so image models don't attempt to render literal, legible HTML/CSS.
