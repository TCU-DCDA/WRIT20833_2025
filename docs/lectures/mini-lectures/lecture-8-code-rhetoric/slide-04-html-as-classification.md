## Slide 4 — HTML as Classification

Filename: `slide4.jpg`
Layout: Two-column (image-left)
Orientation: Portrait (3:4)
Recommended size: 800x1200px

General Style Guidelines (include in every prompt):
- Color palette: Primary Purple #9b59b6; Amber #f1c40f; Light Purple #c9a9ff; Blue #3498db; Green #2ecc71; Red #ff6b6b; Dark backgrounds #1a0330–#2d1b5e.
- Aesthetic: conceptual taxonomy/filing visual, vertical flow, sRGB, JPEG optimized for web, high contrast.
- Emphasis: show semantic tags as organizational power—classification, prioritization, and exclusion; annotate tags and show arrows or flows.

Prompt (primary):
```
Vertical visualization of HTML semantic tags as a classification system. Represent each tag as a labeled container or filing category: <header> at top (entrance/definition zone), <main> in center (core/primary space), <aside> to the margin (secondary/peripheral space), <nav> as pathways connecting categories. Show content flowing into these predetermined categories and arrows indicating how tagging directs attention and assigns importance. Use Primary Purple (#9b59b6) for tag labels and amber accents for emphasis on how classification imposes meaning. Portrait orientation, 3:4 aspect ratio, vertical hierarchy from top to bottom.
```

Alternative prompt:
```
Conceptual vertical image: unsorted content at top, semantic tags in the middle acting like library catalog cards or bureaucratic folders, and sorted/hierarchized content at bottom. Visual cues that tagging isn't neutral but asserts importance.
```

Notes: keep tag labels visually distinct and legible; leave space for slide bullet overlay on the right column.
