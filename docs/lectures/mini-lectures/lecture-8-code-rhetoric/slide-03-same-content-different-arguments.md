## Slide 3 — Same Content, Different Arguments

Filename: `slide3.jpg`
Layout: Full-width comparison
Orientation: Landscape (16:9)
Recommended size: 1200x675px

General Style Guidelines (include in every prompt):
- Color palette: Primary Purple #9b59b6; Amber #f1c40f; Light Purple #c9a9ff; Blue #3498db; Green #2ecc71; Red #ff6b6b; Dark backgrounds #1a0330–#2d1b5e.
- Aesthetic: clear comparison grid, modern mockup feel, sRGB, JPEG optimized for web, high contrast.
- Emphasis: visual proof that identical content arranged differently produces distinct arguments; use distinct color accents per panel for immediate read.

Prompt (primary):
```
Horizontal three-panel comparison showing identical content structured three different ways. Panel 1 (red #e74c3c): academic hierarchy—large expert voices, small community input, top-down structure. Panel 2 (blue #3498db): community-centered—large community voices, small academic framing, grassroots-up structure. Panel 3 (green #2ecc71): dialogic—equal-sized voices, side-by-side layout, collaborative structure. Use the same text/content across all panels so layout and hierarchy are the variable. Landscape orientation, 16:9 aspect ratio, gallery comparison format.
```

Alternative prompt:
```
Three website mockups displayed as browser windows side-by-side, showing the same content but with dramatically different visual hierarchy, color emphasis, and spatial arrangement to illustrate structure = argument. Landscape orientation, clear gutters between panels.
```

Notes: ensure each panel is legible at slide size; include subtle labels for Panel 1/2/3 and a brief caption area.
