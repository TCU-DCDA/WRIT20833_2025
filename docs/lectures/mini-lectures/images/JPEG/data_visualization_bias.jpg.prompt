Creating thumbnail for Lecture 5: Data Has Connotations

This is a placeholder file. The actual thumbnail should be created as a 400x300px JPEG image showing:

PROMPT FOR LECTURE 5 THUMBNAIL:
- Theme: "When Numbers Tell Stories Beyond Facts"
- Visual concept: Data visualization that reveals hidden narratives
- Composition: Charts/graphs with subtle human stories emerging from the data points
- Elements: Bar charts morphing into human silhouettes, pie charts revealing cultural symbols, line graphs forming emotional curves
- Color palette: Cool blues and grays (objective data) with warm reds/oranges highlighting the human stories
- Style: Clean, professional data visualization aesthetic with storytelling elements
- Text: Minimal - perhaps small data labels that hint at human meaning
- Size: 400x300px JPEG under 150KB
- Filename: data_visualization_bias.jpg

The image should suggest that behind every data point is a human story, and that numbers carry cultural and emotional weight beyond their mathematical value.
