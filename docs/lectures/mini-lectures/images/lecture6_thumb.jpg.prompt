Creating thumbnail for Lecture 6: Digital Archaeology

This is a placeholder file. The actual thumbnail should be created as a 400x300px JPEG image showing:

PROMPT FOR LECTURE 6 THUMBNAIL:
- Theme: "Finding Stories in Found Data"
- Visual concept: Archaeological dig site meets digital interface
- Composition: Layered data visualization resembling archaeological strata
- Elements: Ancient pottery shards morphing into data points/code fragments, small brush/excavation tools, layers of earth revealing digital artifacts
- Background: Earth tones (browns, terracotta, sandy colors) representing archaeological dig
- Foreground: Glowing digital highlights (blues, whites) showing data discovery
- Style: Should suggest both ancient discovery and modern analysis
- Metaphor: Data mining as literal archaeological excavation
- Tools: Small brushes, trowels, measuring tools alongside cursors/pixels
- Size: 400x300px JPEG under 150KB  
- Filename: lecture6_thumb.jpg

The image should convey the careful, methodical process of uncovering hidden stories in datasets, similar to how archaeologists uncover artifacts that tell stories about past civilizations.
