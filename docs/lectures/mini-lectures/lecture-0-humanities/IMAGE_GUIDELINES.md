# Image Guidelines for Lecture-0: The Humanities

## Technical Specifications
- **Optimal Size**: 1200x800px (3:2 aspect ratio)
- **Orientation**: Landscape preferred for slide integration
- **Format**: JPEG for photos, PNG for graphics with transparency, GIF for animations
- **File Size**: Keep under 500KB for web performance
- **Text**: Minimal or no text overlay - let the slide text carry the message

## Slide-by-Slide Image Prompts

### Slide 1: Title/Hook - "The Humanities"
**Current Image**: `human_mess.gif` ✅ **PERFECT - KEEP THIS**
- The animated GIF perfectly captures the "mess of the human condition" theme
- Shows complexity, movement, and ambiguity - ideal for the opening

**Alternative if needed**: Abstract visualization of human complexity - overlapping silhouettes, interweaving paths, or cultural artifacts in motion. Warm, inviting colors suggesting depth and richness rather than chaos.

---

### Slide 2: "The Human Mess"
**Current Image**: `forest-for-trees.png` ✅ **GOOD CONNECTION**
- Forest metaphor works well for complexity and multiple perspectives

**Enhancement prompt**: Dense forest with multiple pathways, viewed from above. Dappled light creating complex patterns of shadow and illumination. Paths intersect, diverge, and loop back. Color palette: deep greens with golden light filtering through, suggesting beauty within complexity.

---

### Slide 3: "Different Approaches"
**Current Image**: `tippingScales.png` ✅ **CONCEPTUALLY APPROPRIATE**
- Balance/scales metaphor works for comparing disciplinary approaches

**Enhancement prompt**: Three-panel artistic representation:
- Panel 1: Clean geometric shapes, rulers, mathematical symbols (sciences)
- Panel 2: Statistical charts, population dots, trend lines (social sciences)  
- Panel 3: Open books, multiple interpretive layers, overlapping text fragments (humanities)
Style: Modern, clean illustration with distinct visual languages for each approach.

---

### Slide 4: "A Collection of Disciplines"
**Current Image**: `half_digitized_sculpture.jpg` ✅ **EXCELLENT CHOICE**
- Perfect metaphor for humanities bridging traditional and digital
- Classical meets contemporary - ideal for discipline overview

**Keep current image** - it's conceptually perfect for showing humanities' range and evolution.

---

### Slide 5: "What We Don't Do"
**Current Image**: `data_as_categorization.jpg` ✅ **GOOD FIT**
- Categorization theme works for showing what humanities resist

**Enhancement prompt**: Split-screen composition:
- Left: Neat filing cabinets, labeled boxes, clean categories
- Right: Flowing river, clouds, organic shapes that resist containment
- Bridge or transition zone in middle showing humanities' position between order and mystery
- Color palette: Cool blues/grays (left) transitioning to warm purples/golds (right)

---

### Slide 6: "Cartographers of Complexity"
**Current Image**: `nuance.png` - **NEEDS REPLACEMENT**
- Title suggests mapping metaphor but current image doesn't connect

**New prompt**: Ancient map aesthetic meets modern complexity visualization:
- Parchment-style background with compass rose
- Instead of geographic features: flowing rivers of text, mountains of books, forests of question marks
- Multiple overlaid transparencies suggesting different interpretive layers
- "Here be dragons" style annotations in margins
- Warm sepia tones with touches of color for key landmarks

---

### Slide 7: "What We Offer"
**Current Image**: `forest-for-trees.png` - **CONCEPTUALLY OK**
- Same as Slide 2 - works but repetitive

**New prompt**: Toolkit or treasure chest visualization:
- Open wooden chest revealing diverse "tools": magnifying glass, multiple keys, prism splitting light, compass with multiple needles pointing different directions
- Each tool glowing softly, suggesting value and capability
- Items arranged to suggest they work together rather than compete
- Rich, warm lighting like a Renaissance still life

---

### Slide 8: "When Coding Meets Culture"
**Current Image**: `half_digitized_sculpture.jpg` ✅ **PERFECT - REUSE OK**
- This image perfectly captures the digital humanities concept
- Classical sculpture transitioning to digital/pixels is ideal metaphor

**Keep current image** or create variation with same concept.

---

### Slide 9: "Your Humanities Lens"
**Current Image**: `nuance.png` - **NEEDS REPLACEMENT**
- Should be more personal/reflective

**New prompt**: Multiple lens metaphor - conceptual self-portrait:
- Collection of different lenses/filters suspended in space: camera lens, reading glasses, kaleidoscope, prism, magnifying glass
- Each lens showing different view of the same human scene
- Soft, contemplative lighting
- Suggests multiple ways of seeing and understanding
- Color palette: Deep blues and purples with warm accent lighting

---

## Color Palette Guidelines
- **Primary**: Deep purples (#4d1979, #7c3aed) to match slide theme
- **Accent**: Warm golds, soft whites, muted blues
- **Avoid**: Harsh reds, aggressive oranges, stark black/white contrasts
- **Mood**: Contemplative, rich, intellectually inviting

## Style Guidelines
- **Aesthetic**: Classical meets contemporary
- **Mood**: Thoughtful, complex but not overwhelming
- **Avoid**: Overly literal representations, busy compositions, corporate stock photo aesthetics
- **Embrace**: Metaphorical thinking, layered meaning, artistic interpretation

## Implementation Notes
- Test images at slide size before finalizing
- Ensure sufficient contrast with white text overlay
- Consider animated GIFs sparingly - only where movement adds meaning (like Slide 1)
- Maintain visual consistency across the lecture series while allowing each slide to have its distinct character
