**Layout:** Full-width title slide
**Orientation:** Landscape (16:9)
**Recommended size:** 1200x675px

**Prompt:**
```
HTML document structure shown as architectural blueprint transforming into argumentative framework. Left side: technical HTML anatomy (DOCTYPE, head, body tags) rendered as neutral structural blueprint. Right side: same structure revealed as rhetorical architecture - <header> becomes entrance/framing device, <main> becomes central argument stage, <aside> becomes marginalized space, <footer> becomes concluding position. Blueprint lines transform from technical gray to argumentative purple (#9b59b6) and blue (#3498db). Concept: HTML structure is argument about what matters. Landscape orientation, 16:9 aspect ratio. Modern, conceptual aesthetic showing document-as-building metaphor with critical lens.
```

**Alternative prompt:**
```
Split-screen horizontal composition: Left shows HTML page source code appearing neutral and technical. Right shows same HTML rendered as hierarchical power structure - large centered elements vs small marginalized elements, visible vs hidden, primary vs secondary. Visual bridge showing how structural tags create argumentative hierarchy. Purple and blue color scheme. Landscape orientation, transformation from technical to rhetorical view.
```

**Prompt:**
```
Horizontal side-by-side comparison of two digital archive webpage mockups showing identical content with different HTML structures. Left panel (red border #e74c3c): Academic-centered structure - large <article> for research narrative at top, small <aside> for community voices at bottom. Labeled "Approach A: Academic Frame." Right panel (green border #2ecc71): Community-centered structure - large <main> for community narratives, small <aside> for academic analysis. Labeled "Approach B: Community Frame." Same archival photos appear in both but structural choices create opposite arguments. Center annotation: "Same Content, Different Claims." Landscape orientation, 16:9 aspect ratio, clear structural comparison.
```

**Alternative prompt:**
```
Two website wireframes displayed horizontally showing structural hierarchy differences. Both contain same content elements (community stories, academic analysis, archival photos) but arranged in different semantic tag hierarchies. First emphasizes scholarly voice (large article sections), second emphasizes community voice (large main sections). Visual proof that HTML structure makes argument about whose voice matters. Landscape orientation, wireframe/mockup aesthetic.

Center panel (amber border #f1c40f): Image with minimal alt text (<img alt="photo">) shown with partial access, labeled "BETTER: Minimal access." Right panel (green border #2ecc71): Image with descriptive alt text (<img alt="Civil rights march, 1965, showing protesters carrying signs for voting rights">) shown with open pathways, diverse users accessing content, labeled "GOOD: Full access for all." Concept: accessibility code choices are ethical stances. Landscape orientation, 16:9 aspect ratio, ethical progression from exclusion to inclusion.
```

**Alternative prompt:**
```
Three-column comparison showing same image (historical photo) with three different alt text implementations. First: no alt text, doors closed to users with disabilities. Second: generic alt text, partial access. Third: descriptive contextual alt text, doors wide open.

```
Vertical split comparison showing HTML list types as classification rhetoric. Left column: <ul> unordered list shown as democratic/equal items (all same visual weight, no hierarchy), labeled "Unordered: Items are equal." Right column: <ol> ordered list shown as ranked/sequential items (numbered 1-2-3, hierarchical), labeled "Ordered: Sequence/rank matters." Purple (#9b59b6) for list tags. Bottom annotation in amber (#f1c40f): "Choosing list type = Argument about relationships." Concept: list structure makes claims about whether order/hierarchy exists. Portrait orientation, 3:4 aspect ratio, vertical comparison of classification logic.
```

**Alternative prompt:**
```
Conceptual vertical image comparing organizational systems. Top: unordered list metaphor (items scattered equally, no priority). Bottom: ordered list metaphor (items in strict sequence, ranked). Shows how HTML list choices argue about whether content has inherent order or equality. Visual representation of classification logic in action. Portrait orientation, organizational metaphor.

## General Style Guidelines

**Color Palette (consistent across all images):**
- Primary Purple: #9b59b6 (HTML tags/code elements)
- Light Purple: #c9a9ff (code syntax)
- Blue: #3498db (navigation/links/ethics)
- Green: #2ecc71 (good practices/primary content/main)
- Red: #e74c3c or #ff6b6b (bad practices/header/problems)
- Yellow/Amber: #f1c40f (rhetoric/emphasis/aside/warnings)
- Gray: #95a5a6 (footer/neutral/background)
- Dark Background: #1a0330 to #2d1b5e (when needed)

**Aesthetic Principles:**
- Show HTML structure as argumentative, not neutral
- Semantic tags as classification and power structures
- Hierarchy = argument about importance
- Accessibility as ethical imperative
- Structure creates meaning before style
- Every technical choice is rhetorical
- Prepare for CSS lecture (structure → style progression)
- DH examples showing real applications

**Thematic Emphasis:**
- HTML tags classify and categorize content
- Structure argues what's central vs marginal
- Semantic HTML makes meaning visible to machines and humans
- Heading hierarchy creates importance claims
- Links choose what's worth connecting
- Accessibility code = ethical stance
- Same content, different structure = different argument
- Foundation for visual rhetoric (CSS) to come

**Technical Requirements:**
- **Slides 1, 3, 5, 7, 9:** Landscape orientation (16:9), size 1200x675px
- **Slides 2, 4, 6, 8, 10:** Portrait orientation (3:4), size 800x1200px
- JPEG format for web optimization (target <200KB)
- sRGB color space for web
- High contrast for readability
- Clear conceptual metaphors
- Annotated when helpful for pedagogical clarity
- Shows structure as argument, not neutral container

## Slide-Specific Notes

**Slide 1**: Establish core metaphor - HTML structure is argumentative architecture, not neutral container.

**Slide 2**: Document anatomy as visible/invisible divide. Sets up understanding of head vs body.

**Slide 3**: Semantic HTML5 transformation - from meaningless divs to meaningful classification system.

**Slide 4**: Heading hierarchy as power structure. Visual size = argumentative importance.

**Slide 5**: DH application showing same content, different structures = different claims about whose voice matters.

**Slide 6**: Links/navigation as pathway choices. Hyperlink architecture shapes user journey.

**Slide 7**: Accessibility as ethical responsibility. Alt text choices include or exclude users.

**Slide 8**: List types as classification rhetoric. Ordered vs unordered argues about relationships.

**Slide 9**: Complete page structure showing all elements working together to create argumentative framework.

**Slide 10**: Bridge to next lecture (CSS). Structure provides foundation, style provides visual persuasion.

## Pedagogical Visual Strategy

This lecture teaches **HTML fundamentals with critical DH lens**, so visuals should:
1. **Show structure as argument** - semantic tags make claims about content
2. **Reveal classification logic** - how tags categorize and hierarchize
3. **Connect technical to ethical** - accessibility code as moral choice
4. **Use architectural metaphors** - structure/blueprint/building framework
5. **Prepare for CSS lecture** - establish structure first, style next
6. **Ground in DH examples** - archives, digital projects, scholarly arguments

Color coding:
- **Purple** = HTML tags/code domain
- **Blue** = navigation/links/accessibility/ethics
- **Green** = good practices/primary/main content
- **Red** = problems/exclusion/bad practices
- **Amber** = rhetoric/emphasis/warnings/aside content
- **Gray** = neutral/footer/background

Structure-focused imagery:
- Blueprints, wireframes, architectural diagrams
- Hierarchy pyramids, organizational charts
- Classification systems, sorting mechanisms
- Pathways, navigation maps, signposts
- Before/after structural comparisons
- Annotated mockups showing rhetorical function
