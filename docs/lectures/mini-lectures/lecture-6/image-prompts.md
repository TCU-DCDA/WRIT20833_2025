# Digital Archaeology Mini-Lecture 6: Image Prompts

*Conceptually evocative prompts for slide imagery using Digital Archaeology as the underlying theme*

## Slide 1: Digital Archaeology - Finding Stories in Found Data
**Visual Concept**: Archaeological excavation site reimagined in digital space
**Prompt**: "A mystical archaeological dig site where ancient pottery shards morph into glowing data points floating upward, traditional archaeologist's tools (brushes, trowels) dissolving into streams of binary code, warm earth tones blending with electric blues and purples, sense of discovery and transformation"

## Slide 2: What is "Found Data"?
**Visual Concept**: Digital artifacts scattered across a virtual landscape
**Prompt**: "A vast digital desert with fragments of cultural data emerging from sand dunes - book covers, movie posters, music notes, government documents - all partially buried like archaeological artifacts, soft lighting casting long shadows, mysterious and explorative atmosphere"

## Slide 3: Creating a Data Biography
**Visual Concept**: Archaeological field notes meets digital documentation
**Prompt**: "An ancient scroll unfurling to reveal digital timelines and data pathways, archaeologist's field notebook with handwritten notes transforming into holographic documentation, layers of history visible through translucent digital overlays, scholarly precision with mystical undertones"

## Slide 4: The Ethics of Digital Archaeology
**Visual Concept**: Sacred archaeological site with protective barriers
**Prompt**: "Ancient ruins protected by glowing digital barriers, respectful distance maintained between observer and sacred data artifacts, warning signs in multiple languages floating in air, balance between curiosity and reverence, guardian spirits of data watching over the site"

## Slide 5: From Artifact to Insight
**Visual Concept**: Transformation from raw excavation to museum display
**Prompt**: "Digital artifacts slowly emerging from dark earth into brilliant museum display cases, transformation showing raw data fragments assembling into meaningful cultural narratives, dramatic lighting revealing hidden patterns, sense of revelation and understanding"

## Slide 6: The Pandas Toolkit
**Visual Concept**: Digital archaeological tools laid out with precision
**Prompt**: "Futuristic archaeological toolkit with pandas-inspired tools - digital brushes, data sieves, pattern magnifiers - arranged on ancient stone tablet, tools glowing with soft blue light, blend of traditional craftsmanship with cutting-edge technology"

## Slide 7: Reading the Cultural Landscape
**Visual Concept**: Surveying vast cultural terrain from elevated perspective
**Prompt**: "Aerial view of vast digital landscape with patterns visible only from above - data formations creating cultural topography, ancient surveyor's instruments overlaid with modern analytics displays, sense of scale and pattern recognition"

## Slide 8: Case Study - Book Evolution
**Visual Concept**: Archaeological stratigraphy showing layers of literary history
**Prompt**: "Cross-section view of archaeological dig revealing layers of book evolution - ancient scrolls at bottom, modern e-readers at top, each layer showing publishing trends of its era, time flowing upward through stratified cultural deposits"

## Slide 9: Your Archaeological Mission
**Visual Concept**: Students as digital archaeologists embarking on expedition
**Prompt**: "Group of modern archaeologists equipped with digital tools standing at the edge of a vast data excavation site, sunrise lighting the scene with possibility, maps and charts floating holographically around them, sense of adventure and discovery ahead"
