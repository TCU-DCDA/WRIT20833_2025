**Aesthetic Principles:**
- Clean, modern, educational
- Futuristic but accessible
- Conceptual but clear
- Professional academic tone
- Digital humanities theme
- High contrast for readability
- Minimalist composition
- Abstract where appropriate, concrete when explaining

**Technical Requirements:**
- **Slide 1 only:** Landscape orientation (16:9), size 1200x675px
- **Slides 2-12:** Portrait orientation (3:4), size 800x1200px
- JPEG format for web optimization (target <200KB)
- sRGB color space for web
- Clear focal points
- Readable even when scaled down
- Follow IMAGE_PREP_GUIDE.md specifications

## Usage Notes

1. Generate images in high resolution first, then optimize for web
2. Test images against dark purple background (#1a0330 to #2d1b5e) to ensure visibility
3. If an image doesn't work with first prompt, try the alternative
4. Adjust prompts based on specific AI tool being used (DALL-E vs Midjourney may need different syntax)
5. Consider generating multiple variations and selecting the best fit
6. Ensure all images maintain consistent visual language across the deck
