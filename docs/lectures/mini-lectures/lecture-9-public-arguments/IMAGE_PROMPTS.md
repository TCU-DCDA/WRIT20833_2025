## Bridge Lecture Visual Strategy

This lecture visually bridges two course phases:
- **Purple imagery** = Python/analysis skills (weeks 1-8)
- **Blue imagery** = HTML/CSS/web skills (weeks 9-16)
- **Green imagery** = Public impact (integration/outcome)

Use color strategically to show:
1. What students already know (purple)
2. What they'll learn next (blue)
3. What they'll create together (green)
