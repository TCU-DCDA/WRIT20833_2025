## Slide 1: Title/Hook
**Filename:** `slide1.jpg`
**Layout:** Full-width title slide
**Orientation:** Landscape (16:9)
**Recommended size:** 1200x675px

**Prompt:**
```
CSS properties transforming into visual rhetoric tools. Left side: technical CSS code (font-size, color, margin, position) displayed as neutral syntax. Right side: same properties manifesting as persuasive visual devices - font-size becomes volume dial (loud/quiet arguments), color becomes emotional palette (red urgency, green affirmation), position becomes spatial power (center vs margin), spacing becomes value judgment (generous vs cramped). Code symbols morph into rhetorical instruments. Purple (#9b59b6) and amber (#f1c40f) color scheme. Concept: CSS styling choices are argumentative, not neutral. Landscape orientation, 16:9 aspect ratio. Modern, conceptual aesthetic showing style-as-argument.
```

**Alternative prompt:**
```
Split composition: left shows CSS stylesheet appearing technical and objective. Right shows same CSS rendered as emotional, persuasive visual design - large bold text commanding attention, small gray text being dismissed, vibrant colors creating urgency, generous spacing signaling value. Visual bridge from code-as-technical to style-as-rhetoric. Landscape orientation, transformation narrative.
```

## Slide 2: From Structure to Style
**Filename:** `slide2.jpg`
**Layout:** Two-column (image-left)
**Orientation:** Portrait (3:4)
**Recommended size:** 800x1200px

**Prompt:**
```
Vertical transformation showing HTML wireframe becoming styled design. Top third: bare HTML structure shown as gray wireframe/blueprint - semantic tags visible but unstyled, purely structural. Middle third: transformation arrows or gradient transition. Bottom third: same structure with CSS applied - color adding emotion, typography adding voice, spacing adding hierarchy, layout creating visual emphasis. Purple (#9b59b6) wireframe transitioning to amber (#f1c40f) and colorful styled design. Concept: structure provides logic, style provides persuasion. Portrait orientation, 3:4 aspect ratio, vertical evolution from foundation to realization.
```

**Alternative prompt:**
```
Conceptual vertical image: building construction metaphor. Bottom shows HTML structural framework (skeleton, beams, foundation). Top shows CSS as finishing work (paint, lighting, interior design, visual impact). Annotations showing how structure + style = complete argument. Portrait orientation, construction progress visual.

Middle: CSS selectors acting as spotlights or targeting cursors highlighting specific elements - h1 selector highlighting all h1 tags, .community-voice class selector highlighting specific paragraphs, aside selector highlighting sidebar content. Bottom: selected elements shown with applied styling (large/small, colorful/gray, prominent/marginal). Purple (#9b59b6) for selectors, amber (#f1c40f) for targeted elements. Concept: selectors choose what to emphasize = rhetorical targeting. Portrait orientation, 3:4 aspect ratio, top-to-bottom selection process.
```

**Alternative prompt:**
```
Conceptual vertical image of archery or spotlight targeting metaphor. CSS selectors shown as aiming devices choosing which page elements receive styling attention (emphasis, color, size).

Panel 2: Green (#2ecc71) with symbols of growth, nature, success, go signals, environmental themes, cultural variations. Panel 3: Blue (#3498db) with symbols of trust, calm, professionalism, technology, corporate brands. Panel 4: Gray (#95a5a6) with symbols of neutrality, background, insignificance, disabled states, accessibility concerns. Each panel annotated with "Argues:" and emotional claim. Concept: color is never neutral, always encodes meaning. Landscape orientation, 16:9 aspect ratio, clear four-panel comparison.
```

**Alternative prompt:**
```
Four vertical color columns displayed horizontally showing emotional and cultural associations for red, green, blue, and gray. Each column shows color swatch at top, emotional symbols in middle (hearts for passion, checkmarks for success, shields for trust, disabled icons for gray), cultural context notes at bottom.

```
Vertical split comparison showing same content with different spacing. Left column: generous whitespace layout - ample padding (3rem), generous margins (2rem), comfortable line-height (1.8), breathing room around text, labeled "Valuable, Contemplative, Premium" in green (#2ecc71). Content appears luxurious, unhurried, worthy. Right column: cramped layout - minimal padding (0.2rem), tight margins (0), compressed line-height (1.2), crowded text, labeled "Disposable, Rushed, Utilitarian" in red (#ff6b6b). Content appears cheap, hurried, dense. Annotations showing CSS spacing properties. Concept: space = value judgment. Portrait orientation, 3:4 aspect ratio, vertical side-by-side comparison.
```

**Alternative prompt:**
```
Conceptual vertical image: two rooms with identical furniture. Top room has generous space around each piece (luxury penthouse aesthetic) - breathing room, value, importance. Bottom room has same furniture crammed together (crowded storage unit aesthetic) - disposable, less important. Metaphor for how whitespace in CSS argues about content worth. Portrait orientation, spatial value comparison.

## General Style Guidelines

**Color Palette (consistent across all images):**
- Primary Purple: #9b59b6 (CSS code/selectors)
- Light Purple: #c9a9ff (syntax/code elements)
- Blue: #3498db (accessibility/ethics/trust)
- Green: #2ecc71 (good practices/inclusion/success)
- Red: #e74c3c or #ff6b6b (problems/exclusion/urgency)
- Yellow/Amber: #f1c40f (rhetoric/critical questions/warnings)
- Gray: #95a5a6 (neutral/minimal/marginalized)
- Dark Background: #1a0330 to #2d1b5e (when needed)

**Aesthetic Principles:**
- Show CSS as argumentative styling, not neutral decoration
- Color, typography, layout = rhetorical choices
- Visual emphasis = claims about importance
- Spacing = value judgments
- Responsive design = access ethics
- Every style choice encodes cultural meaning
- Design with critical awareness
- Connects visual rhetoric to DH practice

**Thematic Emphasis:**
- CSS selectors choose what to emphasize (targeting = power)
- Color encodes emotion and cultural meaning (never neutral)
- Typography gives content voice and personality
- Layout creates spatial hierarchies (center vs margin)
- Whitespace argues about worth (generous vs cramped)
- Responsive design determines access (inclusion vs exclusion)
- All styling choices are arguments about value
- Critical design practice integrates ethics and aesthetics

**Technical Requirements:**
- **Slides 1, 4, 6, 8:** Landscape orientation (16:9), size 1200x675px
- **Slides 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10:** Portrait orientation (3:4), size 800x1200px
- JPEG format for web optimization (target <200KB)
- sRGB color space for web
- High contrast for readability
- Clear conceptual metaphors
- Annotated when helpful for pedagogical clarity
- Shows style as argument, not decoration

## Slide-Specific Notes

**Slide 1**: Establish core metaphor - CSS properties are rhetorical tools, not neutral styling.

**Slide 2**: Foundation (HTML structure) + styling (CSS) = complete argument. Structure + voice.

**Slide 3**: CSS selectors as targeting mechanism. Choosing what receives emphasis = power.

**Slide 4**: Color psychology and cultural associations. Color is never neutral, always argues.

**Slide 5**: Typography as voice and tone. Font choice gives text personality and authority.

**Slide 6**: Spatial positioning creates power hierarchies. Center vs margin = importance claims.

**Slide 7**: Whitespace argues about value. Generous spacing = worth, cramped = disposable.

**Slide 8**: DH application showing same content/structure with different CSS = different argument about whose voice matters.

**Slide 9**: Responsive design as ethical access decision. Mobile-first = inclusive, desktop-only = exclusive.

**Slide 10**: Designer with critical awareness making ethical CSS choices. Shift from decoration to rhetoric.

## Pedagogical Visual Strategy

This lecture teaches **CSS fundamentals with rhetorical and ethical lens**, so visuals should:
1. **Show style as argument** - visual choices make claims about importance
2. **Reveal emotional/cultural coding** - color, font, spacing carry meaning
3. **Connect aesthetics to ethics** - accessibility, inclusion, cultural sensitivity
4. **Use before/after comparisons** - same content, different styling, different arguments
5. **Ground in DH examples** - oral histories, archives, digital scholarship
6. **Prepare for integration** - structure (HTML) + style (CSS) = complete rhetorical practice

Color coding:
- **Purple** = CSS code/syntax
- **Amber** = rhetoric/critical questions/emphasis
- **Blue** = accessibility/ethics/trust
- **Green** = good practices/inclusion/success
- **Red** = problems/exclusion/urgency
- **Gray** = neutral/minimal/marginalized

Visual themes:
- Transformation (code → visual argument)
- Targeting/selection (selectors choosing emphasis)
- Emotional/cultural associations (color, typography)
- Spatial power (layout, position, visibility)
- Value judgments (whitespace, hierarchy)
- Access ethics (responsive design)
- Critical design practice (awareness + ethics)
