# Image Generation Prompts for Mini-Lecture 5: "Data Has Connotations"
## WRIT 20833 - When Coding Meets Culture

### Visual Style Guidelines:
- **Aesthetic**: Digital humanities, academic, thoughtful, slightly surreal
- **Color Palette**: Deep purples, blues, with accent colors (matching lecture styling)
- **Mood**: Critical, questioning, sophisticated
- **Elements**: Data visualizations, cultural symbols, human figures, abstract concepts
- **Avoid**: Overly corporate/business imagery, simplistic charts, cliché tech imagery

## Slide 1: Title Slide
**Filename**: `data_visualization_bias.jpg`  
**Alt Text**: "Data visualization showing bias"

**Prompt**:
"Create a conceptual digital art piece showing data visualization with hidden bias. Feature multiple bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts that appear neutral at first glance, but upon closer inspection reveal distortions, missing data points, and skewed perspectives. Include subtle visual metaphors like magnifying glasses revealing hidden details, shadows casting different interpretations, or the same data being viewed through different colored lenses. Use a sophisticated color palette of deep purples and blues with accent colors. Style should be thoughtful and academic, suitable for a digital humanities lecture. The image should suggest that data tells different stories depending on how it's presented and who's interpreting it."

## Slide 2: The Myth of Neutral Data
**Filename**: `neutral_data_myth.jpg`  
**Alt Text**: "Data neutrality concept"

**Prompt**:
"Design a conceptual image that deconstructs the myth of neutral data. Show a pristine, seemingly objective data visualization (clean white background, perfect geometric charts) being deconstructed to reveal human hands, cultural symbols, and value judgments embedded within. Include visual elements like masks being removed from numbers, revealing faces underneath, or clean data being shown with its messy, human origins. Use metaphors like an iceberg (tip showing clean data, bulk below showing bias and assumptions), or a theater stage where 'neutral' data is revealed to have directors, scripts, and hidden agendas. Color palette should contrast sterile whites/grays with warmer, more human tones."

## Slide 3: Denotation vs Connotation
**Filename**: `meaning_layers.jpg`  
**Alt Text**: "Layers of meaning"

**Prompt**:
"Create an artistic visualization of layered meaning in data. Show the same numerical information existing at multiple levels - a literal surface layer showing clean numbers and statistics, with deeper, translucent layers beneath revealing cultural associations, emotional responses, social hierarchies, and political implications. Use visual metaphors like geological strata, transparent overlays, or a archaeological dig where the same artifact (data point) means different things at different depths. Include subtle imagery suggesting that simple numbers carry complex cultural baggage. The composition should feel like peeling back layers of an onion or looking through multiple filters. Use sophisticated color gradients and transparency effects."

## Slide 4: Case Study - Test Scores  
**Filename**: `test_scores_interpretation.jpg`  
**Alt Text**: "Test score interpretations"

**Prompt**:
"Design an image showing three different lenses interpreting the same educational data. Show a central SAT score or test result that branches into three distinct narrative paths, each with different visual treatments: one path shows deficit framing (darker, downward arrows, individual failure imagery), another shows systemic perspective (institutional buildings, resource inequality, structural barriers), and a third shows cultural bias perspective (different types of intelligence, cultural knowledge systems, questioning the test itself). Use visual metaphors like prisms splitting light, kaleidoscopes showing different patterns, or the same mountain viewed from three different vantage points. Include subtle academic and educational imagery."

## Slide 5: Who Controls the Story?
**Filename**: `data_storytelling_power.jpg`  
**Alt Text**: "Power in data storytelling"

**Prompt**:
"Create a powerful visual metaphor for institutional control over data narratives. Show puppet strings or conductor's batons directing how data is presented, with different institutional figures (government buildings, media towers, research universities) each pulling or shaping the same data in different directions. Include imagery of spotlights highlighting certain data points while leaving others in shadow, megaphones amplifying specific interpretations, or editors cutting and arranging data like film strips. The image should suggest that raw data doesn't speak for itself - it's always being shaped by someone with particular interests and agendas. Use dynamic composition with clear power dynamics and hierarchies."

## Slide 6: Missing Data, Missing Voices
**Filename**: `data_exclusion.jpg`  
**Alt Text**: "Data exclusion visualization"

**Prompt**:
"Design a haunting visualization of absence and exclusion in data. Show a dataset or survey with obvious gaps, missing pieces, or silhouettes of people who should be there but aren't. Use visual metaphors like incomplete puzzles, faded photographs with missing people, census forms with blank spaces, or data tables with empty rows representing uncounted populations. Include imagery suggesting the ghosts of missing data - shadow figures at the edges of charts, dotted lines where data should be, or transparent overlays showing what's not being measured. The mood should be thoughtful and somewhat melancholic, highlighting that absence from data doesn't mean absence from reality."

## Slide 7: Digital Humanities Implications
**Filename**: `dh_data_ethics.jpg`  
**Alt Text**: "Digital humanities data ethics"

**Prompt**:
"Create an image representing ethical digital humanities practice with data. Show scholars or researchers working with cultural artifacts, historical documents, and digital archives while being mindful of representation and bias. Include visual elements like scales of justice balanced with data and cultural sensitivity, diverse voices being centered in research, or careful hands preserving both quantitative data and human stories. Use imagery suggesting careful curation, ethical reflection, and community engagement. Include subtle academic symbols (books, artifacts, diverse cultural objects) integrated with modern digital tools. The mood should be respectful, thoughtful, and collaborative."

## Slide 8: Call to Action - Critical Data Practice
**Filename**: `critical_data_practice.jpg`  
**Alt Text**: "Critical data practice"

**Prompt**:
"Design an empowering image showing active, critical engagement with data. Show diverse students or researchers equipped with tools for critical analysis - magnifying glasses revealing hidden assumptions, question marks floating around data visualizations, multiple perspectives being considered simultaneously, and communities being centered in the research process. Include imagery of people asking questions, comparing different interpretations, and building bridges between quantitative analysis and qualitative understanding. Use visual metaphors like detectives investigating data, scholars in dialogue with communities, or builders constructing more ethical analytical frameworks. The mood should be hopeful, active, and transformative."

## Technical Specifications:
- **Format**: JPEG or PNG
- **Resolution**: High resolution for projection (minimum 1920x1080)
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 or 4:3 depending on slide layout needs
- **File Size**: Optimized for web delivery (under 2MB each)
- **Accessibility**: High contrast, clear visual hierarchy for screen readers

## Style Consistency Notes:
These images should complement the existing mini-lecture aesthetic established in lectures 1-4. They should feel sophisticated and academic while remaining visually engaging and conceptually rich. Each image should be able to stand alone as a thought-provoking piece while also supporting the specific learning objectives of its corresponding slide.
