## Slide 1: Title/Hook
**Filename:** `data_visualization_bias.jpg`
**Layout:** Full-width title slide
**Orientation:** Landscape (16:9)
**Recommended size:** 1200x675px

**Prompt:**
```
A striking data visualization split down the middle showing the same data interpreted two different ways. Left side: clean bar chart with neutral colors suggesting positive interpretation. Right side: same data shown with different framing suggesting problematic interpretation. Subtle visual cues showing bias in presentation - color choices, axis manipulation, selective highlighting. Color palette: purples (#c9a9ff, #9b59b6), blues (#4cc9f0), and cautionary reds (#ff6b6b). Modern infographic style with critical lens. Landscape orientation, 16:9 aspect ratio.
```

**Alternative prompt:**
```
Abstract visualization of numbers and data points floating in space, each casting different colored shadows and refractions representing multiple interpretations. Central dataset splits into diverging narrative paths shown by colored light rays. Dark background with purple, blue, and amber accent lighting. Conceptual representation of subjective data interpretation. Landscape orientation, horizontal composition.
```

## Slide 2: The Myth of Neutral Data
**Filename:** `neutral_data_myth.jpg`
**Layout:** Centered image
**Orientation:** Square (1:1)
**Recommended size:** 800x800px

**Prompt:**
```
A glowing data table or spreadsheet suspended in space, appearing pristine and objective at first glance. Upon closer inspection, subtle cracks reveal human hands manipulating the data from behind/beneath - selecting what to count, what to exclude. The "neutral" surface breaking apart to show layers of human decision-making underneath. Purple (#c9a9ff) and red (#ff6b6b) color scheme suggesting caution and scrutiny. Clean but conceptual illustration style. Square format, balanced composition.
```

**Alternative prompt:**
```
Minimalist composition: a perfect, polished data cube at center appearing objective and neutral. Around it, translucent layers showing the invisible human choices - what questions were asked, who was included, what was measured. Each layer glows with different intensity. Dark background with purple and red accents. Conceptual, philosophical aesthetic. Square orientation.
```

## Slide 3: Denotation vs Connotation
**Filename:** `meaning_layers.jpg`
**Layout:** Centered image
**Orientation:** Square (1:1)
**Recommended size:** 800x800px

**Prompt:**
```
Side-by-side comparison visual. Left: simple, clean number "67%" in clinical blue (#4cc9f0) with dictionary-style definition underneath. Right: same "67%" surrounded by swirling interpretive layers - emotional responses, cultural meanings, power implications shown as translucent purple (#c9a9ff) rings expanding outward. Concept: denotation (literal) vs connotation (interpretive). Educational infographic style with visual metaphor for meaning layers. Square format.
```

**Alternative prompt:**
```
Cross-section view of a data point like geological layers. Surface layer: clean number. Deeper layers flowing downward: cultural assumptions, historical context, power dynamics, emotional weight - each layer distinct color and texture. Like an iceberg showing what's beneath the surface. Purple, blue, and amber color coding. Square orientation, centered composition.
```

## Slide 4: Case Study - Test Scores
**Filename:** `test_scores_interpretation.jpg`
**Layout:** Centered image
**Orientation:** Square (1:1)
**Recommended size:** 800x800px

**Prompt:**
```
Three panels showing the same test score data interpreted differently. Top panel (red #ff6b6b): deficit frame showing students as failing. Middle panel (yellow #ffd93d): systemic frame showing resource inequality. Bottom panel (blue #4cc9f0): cultural frame showing assessment bias. Same bar chart in each panel but different visual emphasis, annotations, and emotional tone. Educational comparison infographic. Square format, vertically stacked panels.
```

**Alternative prompt:**
```
A central standardized test score dataset radiating outward into three distinct interpretive paths, each path glowing a different color: red (deficit), yellow (systemic), blue (cultural). Each path leads to different conclusions visualized as distinct symbolic endpoints. Concept: data as diverging interpretations. Square orientation, radial composition.
```

## Slide 5: The Power in Framing
**Filename:** `data_storytelling_power.jpg`
**Layout:** Centered image
**Orientation:** Square (1:1)
**Recommended size:** 800x800px

**Prompt:**
```
A hand holding a camera or frame, choosing what to include and exclude from a complex data landscape. Inside the frame: carefully curated data points telling one story. Outside the frame (visible but grayed): contradictory data and missing context. Spotlight effect showing what gets emphasized. Purple (#9b59b6) and yellow (#ffd93d) lighting suggesting editorial power. Conceptual representation of selective framing. Square format, dramatic composition.
```

**Alternative prompt:**
```
Multiple overlapping picture frames or camera viewfinders all pointed at the same complex dataset, each frame capturing a different subset creating different narratives. Some frames emphasize certain data points while excluding others. Visual metaphor for editorial control and perspective. Dark background with purple and amber accent lighting. Square orientation.
```

## Slide 6: What Gets Counted?
**Filename:** `data_exclusion.jpg`
**Layout:** Centered image
**Orientation:** Square (1:1)
**Recommended size:** 800x800px

**Prompt:**
```
A data collection net or grid catching certain data points (shown in bright purple #c9a9ff) while other data points (in faded red #ff6b6b) pass through the gaps or fall outside the frame entirely. Visual metaphor for what gets included vs excluded in data collection. Some silhouettes of people fade into shadows at edges, representing marginalized voices. Thoughtful, critical aesthetic. Square format.
```

**Alternative prompt:**
```
Split composition: left side shows official, counted data as bright, visible points in a clean grid. Right side reveals the shadow data - uncounted experiences, unmeasured lives, excluded perspectives shown as ghosted, translucent shapes in darkness. Border between counted and uncounted emphasized. Red and purple color scheme. Square orientation.
```

## Slide 7: Digital Humanities Approach
**Filename:** `dh_data_ethics.jpg`
**Layout:** Centered image
**Orientation:** Square (1:1)
**Recommended size:** 800x800px

**Prompt:**
```
A scholar's desk viewed from above with layered holographic displays floating above showing: 1) raw data layer, 2) historical context layer, 3) cultural interpretation layer, 4) ethical considerations layer. Each layer semi-transparent and color-coded (blue, purple, green, amber). Books and notes visible on desk. Represents multi-dimensional DH approach to data. Warm study lighting with cool digital accents. Square format, top-down view.
```

**Alternative prompt:**
```
An open book or archive at center with data visualizations floating above it, but each visualization includes annotations asking critical questions: "Who collected this?", "What's missing?", "Whose perspective?", "What assumptions?". Questions glow in amber (#ffd93d), data in purple (#c9a9ff). Represents reflective, humanistic data practice. Square orientation.
```

---

## Slide 8: Your Turn - Critical Data Practice
**Filename:** `critical_data_practice.jpg`
**Layout:** Centered image
**Orientation:** Square (1:1)
**Recommended size:** 800x800px

**Prompt:**
```
A magnifying glass examining a data visualization, revealing four distinct analytical lenses represented as colored filters or layers: purple for "who collected?", blue for "interpretation questions", green for "presentation context", amber for "community voices". Each lens reveals different aspects of the same data. Tools of critical inquiry scattered around - notebooks, questions, diverse perspectives. Empowering, educational mood. Square format.
```

**Alternative prompt:**
```
Hands of diverse people from different angles all examining the same dataset from different perspectives, each person's viewpoint highlighted with different colored light (purple, blue, green, amber). Central data glows at intersection of all perspectives. Concept: collaborative, multi-perspective critical data analysis. Inclusive, thoughtful aesthetic. Square orientation.
```

## General Style Guidelines

**Color Palette (consistent across all images):**
- Primary Purple: #9b59b6
- Light Purple: #c9a9ff
- Cyan/Blue: #4cc9f0
- Yellow/Amber: #ffd93d
- Red (caution): #ff6b6b
- Green (insight): #2ecc71
- Dark Background: #1a0330 to #2d1b5e

**Aesthetic Principles:**
- Critical, thoughtful, questioning
- Conceptual but accessible
- Shows complexity and nuance
- Avoids oversimplification
- Humanistic technology approach
- Inclusive visual language
- Professional academic tone
- Reveals hidden layers and power dynamics

**Thematic Emphasis:**
- Data is never neutral
- Multiple interpretations exist
- Power shapes what gets counted
- Context matters critically
- Human decisions embedded in data
- Missing data = missing voices
- Critical questioning essential

**Technical Requirements:**
- **Slide 1 only:** Landscape orientation (16:9), size 1200x675px
- **Slides 2-8:** Square orientation (1:1), size 800x800px
- JPEG format for web optimization (target <200KB)
- sRGB color space for web
- High contrast for readability against dark backgrounds
- Clear focal points
- Symbolic/conceptual rather than literal
- Meaningful even when scaled down

## Usage Notes

1. **Conceptual over literal**: These images should evoke ideas about data interpretation, power, and bias rather than showing literal screenshots of data
2. **Maintain critical tone**: Visual language should invite questioning and scrutiny, not present data as authoritative
3. **Show layers**: Many slides benefit from showing multiple layers, perspectives, or hidden dimensions
4. **Inclusive representation**: When showing people, ensure diversity and avoid stereotypes
5. **Test against dark background**: All images will display against purple-dark backgrounds (#1a0330 to #2d1b5e)
6. **Balance abstraction and clarity**: Conceptual but still communicates the core idea clearly

---

## Slide-Specific Notes

**Slide 1**: Should immediately establish that same data = different stories. Visual tension important.

**Slide 2**: Should visually "crack open" the myth of objectivity. Reveal mechanism underneath.

**Slide 3**: Clear visual distinction between surface meaning and deeper interpretive layers.

**Slide 4**: Same data, three frames - visual consistency important to show it's the same data interpreted differently.

**Slide 5**: Emphasize editorial power - someone chooses the frame, the story.

**Slide 6**: What's missing is as important as what's present. Absence should be visible.

**Slide 7**: Should feel scholarly, reflective, multi-dimensional. DH ethos.

**Slide 8**: Empowering, practical, tool-oriented. Critical thinking as actionable practice.
