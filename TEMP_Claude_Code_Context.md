# Context for Claude Code: HTML/CSS Training & Semester Project Balance

**Date**: October 8, 2025  
**Course**: WRIT20833 "When Coding Meets Culture: Developing Data-Driven Opinions"  
**Question**: Balance of HTML/CSS training with workshop time on semester project over next 20 class sessions

## Current State

### Course Progress
- **Timeline**: 20 class sessions remaining (roughly Weeks 9-16)
- **Student Progress**: 
  - ✅ Completed HW4-1 (term frequency analysis & sentiment analysis with VADER)
  - ✅ Completed HW4-2 (topic modeling with Gensim LDA & integration reflection)
  - 🎯 Starting HW5 (final project proposal only - not the full project!)
  - 📋 **Need to Plan**: HW6+ HTML/CSS training assignments leading to final project

### Assignment Structure & Final Project
**Theme**: "When Coding Meets Culture: Developing Data-Driven Opinions"

**Current Sequence**:
- **HW5**: Final Project Proposal (8-point proposal building on HW4 insights)
- **HW6, HW7, HW8+**: HTML/CSS Training Assignments (TBD number - this is what we need to plan!)
- **Final Project**: End-of-term submission with four required deliverables

**Final Project Deliverables**:
1. **Research Essay** (1500-2000 words): Academic analysis of research process, methods, and findings
2. **Python Notebooks** (.ipynb files): Complete computational analysis demonstrating three base methods
3. **Dataset Documentation** (CSV files + data biography): Clean, well-documented datasets with ethical collection documentation
4. **HTML/CSS Portfolio** (web-based): Public-facing presentation of research findings and insights

### Student Context
- **Technical Level**: Complete beginners to web development
- **Rich Content**: Students have substantial text analysis projects to showcase
  - Term frequency results and visualizations
  - Sentiment analysis findings (VADER)
  - Topic modeling discoveries (Gensim LDA)
  - Integration reflections on "being wrong" as learning
- **Final Goal**: Public-facing portfolio suitable for academic/career use

## Core Challenge

**How to structure HTML/CSS training assignments (HW6+) and balance with final project workshop time across 20 class sessions?**

Students need to:
1. **HW5 Complete**: Submit project proposals (building on HW4-1/HW4-2 analysis)
2. **HW6+ Training**: Learn web development fundamentals through structured assignments
3. **Final Project**: Apply HTML/CSS skills to showcase their complete text analysis journey
4. **Portfolio Creation**: Develop professional presentations of "data-driven opinion" development

## Specific Questions for Claude Code

### 1. **Assignment Structure**
- How many HTML/CSS training assignments (HW6, HW7, HW8+) are optimal?
- Should each assignment focus on one skill (HTML basics, CSS styling, GitHub Pages) or integrate multiple skills?
- How to structure assignments to build toward the final portfolio systematically?

### 2. **Pacing Strategy**
- How many sessions for HTML basics vs. CSS fundamentals vs. portfolio application?
- When to introduce concepts vs. when to focus on applying them to student data?
- How to balance new skill instruction with project development time?

### 3. **Integration Approach**
- Should HTML/CSS be taught abstractly first, then applied to projects?
- Or should web development be taught through direct application to their text analysis results?
- How to connect web development skills to their existing computational analysis work?

### 4. **Assessment & Milestones**
- Should HTML/CSS assignments be graded separately or as portfolio preparation?
- When should portfolio check-ins/milestones occur during the HTML/CSS training phase?
- How to scaffold progress toward final portfolio deadline?

### 5. **Differentiated Support**
- How to support students who struggle with technical concepts while others advance?
- How to structure class time for both instruction and individual support?
- How to keep advanced students engaged while others master basics?

## Planning Documents Available

### Current Files to Reference:
- `_development/NEXT_STEPS_HTML_CSS_PORTFOLIO.md` - Detailed HTML/CSS curriculum plan (7 CodeAlong notebooks planned)
- `docs/WRIT20833_Final_Project_Requirements.md` - Complete final project requirements with ungrading philosophy
- `notebooks/homework/WRIT20833_HW5_Final_Project_Proposal.md` - HW5 proposal structure (8-point proposal building on HW4 insights)

### Course Philosophy
- **Assessment**: "Earned insight over clean code" (ungrading approach)
- **Learning Arc**: Students move from assumptions → computational analysis → data-driven opinions → public presentation
- **Integration**: Technical skills connected to humanities interpretation throughout

## Technical Requirements

### Development Environment (Planned):
- **VS Code** for local development (familiar interface, live preview)
- **GitHub Desktop** for version control (visual, beginner-friendly git)
- **GitHub Pages** for deployment (public portfolio hosting)
- **Workflow**: Create locally → Preview locally → Commit visually → Share globally

### HTML/CSS Scope (Beginner-Friendly):
- **HTML**: Semantic structure, basic tags, content organization
- **CSS**: Typography, colors, basic layout (simple flexbox)
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages setup and maintenance
- **Integration**: Presenting computational analysis results in web format

## Request for Claude Code

Please help design an optimal 20-session balance that:
1. **Builds essential HTML/CSS skills** for humanities students
2. **Maximizes hands-on application** to their text analysis projects  
3. **Supports diverse learning paces** in technical skill acquisition
4. **Culminates in professional portfolios** showcasing their complete analytical journey
5. **Maintains course focus** on cultural analysis rather than becoming a pure web development course
