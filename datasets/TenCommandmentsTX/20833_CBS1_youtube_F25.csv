"Why would we push on belief on all children? I thought we were built to have religious freedom? And it seemed pretty clear that government has no place in enforcing religion on anyone. I'm not saying you shouldn't teach children about religion. But If you're going to teach and bring up one religion you really need to bring them all up. Or come up with a type of commandments that are just about school and common American rules rules. Why does it have to be something written in the Bible? 

Always respect the adults and teachers and adults around you. 

I will never place my hands on other people. 

I will always clean up after myself. 

I won't ever steal. 

School is no place for lying so I will not lie. 

Etc etc.. 

I am absolutely four freedom of religion. We are already slowly losing a lot of freedoms.

"That is INSANE! Only argument I could understand would be private schools - but Jewish/ Christian/ Muslim private schools should not have any issue; and in reality, our Legal system is summarized by the 10 Commandments.

From our founding, the 10 Commandments were taught in every school (so the argument that it is against the Constitution is false, and the establishment of religion clause is that the FEDERAL Govmt shall not force a National Religion, not States-> though this wouldn’t fit under making a State Religion, either).","Show less","Read more","Like","","Dislike","Reply","1 reply"
"I'm surprised that the That real court is allowed to do that , since you enforced the bible laws. Over six hundred and fifty laws and organisms of moses plus to take amendments. The united states entirely court system is based on mosaic law. But my small town judged to the supreme court and all of those laws are of god.. It's a fact including the right to sue.. Is the federal court enforces Bible law?And how can you say they can't display it in a courtroom. Or a schoolroom. Only one of the ten commandments is not a u s law. Thou shalt not Commit false witness against a neighbor perjury. You're not allowed to perjure yourself in a federal court. Only one of the ten commandments is not enforced thou shalt not have any other guide before you. That's the only ten commandment that's not enforced by law.. Then again, all that gay stuff is the other part of the Bible following  says disobedience to god is sin . Sin Disobedience against gods Will and law is called evil. That's right simple Disobedience against god Is what The bible considers evil. You forced the other half of the bible in your classrooms Therefore you can put the good part of the bible and force it in the classroom as well.
