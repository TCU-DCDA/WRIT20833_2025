To get started, decide as a group whether you plan to 1) start with fresh data or 2) build on your work started in Homework 4-1 &amp; 4-2 (HW4). Either way, your final project must refine, deepen, and/or expand the work you completed for HW4.&nbsp; Imagine the Semester Project as a scaled-up version of HW4.&nbsp; You can "increase the scale" of HW4 in the following ways:

by drafting and pursuing and updating a more substantial Research Question &amp; Hypothesis

by scraping and analyzing larger Datasets

by scraping and analyzing a greater number of Datasets

by refining and/or expanding your Methods

by refining your Deliverables

For your Proposal, please confirm in your replies to each bullet point below how your project will refine, deepen, and/or expand the work you practiced or started in HW4:

Your current&nbsp;answer to this question: &nbsp;How do the Humanities and Data Analytics complement each other?&nbsp; What does each discipline provide the other that they lack on their own?&nbsp; (You're encouraged to refine the ideas your first formulated in Threaded Discussion 1 or that you negotiate in your group).&nbsp;
Your broad topic or area of concern that will give you an opportunity to illustrate your answer to the question above
Your current (focused and manageable) Research Question that emerges from some current debate or concern related to your broad topic (you may need to draft several versions before you find your focus)
Your initial Hypothesis (your current provisional answer to the Research Question that your project will test through an analysis of collected data)
The&nbsp;Dataset(s) you'll be working with (found or scraped)
The Method(s) you'll use (for example, TF, Sentimental Analysis, Topic Modeling, Close Reading, Others?)
If working in a group, a description of the Division of labor (who is responsible for what task?)&nbsp;
