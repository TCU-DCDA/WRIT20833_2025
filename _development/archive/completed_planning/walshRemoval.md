# Walsh Content Removal Plan

**Purpose**: Ensure textbook independence from Melanie Walsh's "Introduction to Cultural Analytics" while maintaining acknowledgment as inspiration and resource.

**Goal**: Create original content, exercises, and examples that reflect the unique "When Coding Meets Culture" approach while removing direct dependencies on Walsh's materials.

---

## Current Walsh Dependencies Identified

### **Critical Dependencies (Must Remove)**

#### **1. Homework 1 (WRIT20833_HW1_Fall2025.ipynb)**
**Current Issue**: Direct reliance on Walsh's text processing example
- Uses Walsh's stopwords list
- References her methodology for "meaningful words" analysis
- Follows her exercise structure and approach

**Removal Plan**:
- [ ] Replace "meaningful words" concept with original "cultural keywords" or "significance analysis"
- [ ] Create original stopwords approach (perhaps cultural context-specific)
- [ ] Develop new exercise framework focused on humanities questions rather than technical demonstration
- [ ] Replace text files with culturally relevant alternatives (social media posts, song lyrics, contemporary essays)

#### **2. Tutorial Prerequisites (All 4 Tutorials)**
**Current Issue**: Explicit references to Walsh chapters as prerequisites
```markdown
"This tutorial assumes you have completed the following chapters from Melanie Walsh's Introduction to Cultural Analytics"
```

**Removal Plan**:
- [ ] Replace with references to our own textbook chapters
- [ ] Create original prerequisite descriptions based on learning objectives rather than external text
- [ ] Develop self-contained skill assessments

### **Moderate Dependencies (Should Remove)**

#### **3. CodeAlong Notebooks**
**Current Issue**: Structure and progression may mirror Walsh's approach
- Variable introduction methods
- Data type explanations
- String method progression

**Removal Plan**:
- [ ] Audit content for direct parallels
- [ ] Develop original examples using contemporary cultural materials
- [ ] Create unique pedagogical progression that emphasizes critical thinking from the start

#### **4. Exercise Structure Templates**
**Current Issue**: Weekly exercise outline may follow Walsh's organizational patterns

**Removal Plan**:
- [ ] Develop original exercise framework based on "sacred boundaries" and classification logic themes
- [ ] Create culturally-focused activity structures
- [ ] Design assessment criteria that emphasize digital humanities thinking

### **Minor Dependencies (Review and Modify)**

#### **5. Technical Concept Introductions**
**Current Issue**: Some explanations may echo Walsh's language or examples

**Removal Plan**:
- [ ] Audit all technical explanations for original voice
- [ ] Replace programming examples with humanities-specific scenarios
- [ ] Ensure all code examples serve cultural analysis goals

---

## Replacement Strategy

### **1. Original Conceptual Framework**

#### **Replace Technical-First Approach with Culture-First Approach**
- **Walsh**: "Learn Python, then apply to humanities"
- **Our Approach**: "Understand cultural questions, learn code to answer them"

#### **New Core Concepts**:
- **Digital Boundaries**: Instead of general text processing
- **Classification Power**: Instead of neutral data categorization  
- **Algorithmic Agency**: Instead of simple automation
- **Cultural Memory**: Instead of data storage

### **2. Original Exercise Types**

#### **Week 1: Digital Identity Construction**
**Replace**: Basic variable assignment
**New Focus**: How personal data becomes digital identity
- Create variables representing different aspects of digital self
- Explore what gets measured vs. what gets ignored
- Question who controls these classifications

#### **Week 2: Boundary Making Code** 
**Replace**: Lists and loops practice
**New Focus**: How code creates access and exclusion
- Analyze permission systems (voting, dating apps, course registration)
- Code simple classification rules
- Discuss fairness and bias in automated decisions

#### **Week 3: Cultural Data Archaeology**
**Replace**: File handling exercises  
**New Focus**: Extracting meaning from digital cultural artifacts
- Process song lyrics, social media posts, news headlines
- Build tools to uncover cultural patterns
- Connect technical skills to interpretive questions

#### **Week 4: Visualization as Argument**
**Replace**: Basic plotting practice
**New Focus**: Charts and graphs as rhetorical tools
- Create visualizations that make cultural arguments
- Analyze how presentation shapes interpretation
- Design for specific audiences and purposes

### **3. Original Assessment Framework**

#### **Replace Technical Proficiency Focus with Critical Analysis Focus**

**Current Walsh-style Assessment**:
- "Does the code run correctly?"
- "Are programming concepts applied properly?"

**New Assessment Criteria**:
- "What cultural insight does this analysis reveal?"
- "How does the technical approach serve the humanistic question?"
- "What biases or limitations does this method introduce?"
- "How effectively does this present findings to a public audience?"

### **4. Original Dataset Collection**

#### **Replace Generic Text Collections with Culturally Curated Materials**

**Remove Walsh-style Datasets**:
- Classic literature for basic text analysis
- Generic news articles for sentiment practice
- Academic paper abstracts for topic modeling

**New Dataset Strategy**:
- **Contemporary Cultural Artifacts**: TikTok comments, song lyrics, podcast transcripts
- **Power and Classification**: Dating app profiles, job listings, college admissions essays
- **Digital Memory**: Social media archives, deleted content recoveries, platform policy changes
- **Boundary Negotiations**: Privacy policies, terms of service, content moderation decisions

## Implementation Timeline

### **Phase 1: Remove Direct Dependencies (October 2025)**
- [ ] Rewrite all tutorial prerequisites to reference internal content
- [ ] Replace HW1 with original exercise focusing on digital boundaries
- [ ] Audit CodeAlong notebooks for Walsh-specific language/examples

### **Phase 2: Develop Original Content (November-December 2025)**
- [ ] Create new Week 1-4 exercises with cultural focus
- [ ] Design original assessment rubrics emphasizing critical thinking
- [ ] Develop culturally-specific datasets and examples

### **Phase 3: Ensure Conceptual Independence (January-February 2026)**
- [ ] Review all content for unconscious parallels to Walsh's approach
- [ ] Strengthen unique theoretical framework throughout
- [ ] Test exercises with students to ensure clarity without Walsh reference

### **Phase 4: Proper Attribution (Spring 2026)**
- [ ] Create "Further Reading" section acknowledging Walsh as inspiration
- [ ] Include Walsh's text in bibliography as foundational resource
- [ ] Write preface explaining relationship to existing digital humanities pedagogy

- [ ] Pedagogical approach is demonstrably different (culture-first vs. technical-first)
- [ ] Assessment criteria emphasize unique learning objectives

### **Conceptual Originality Verification**

- [ ] Core frameworks (boundaries, classification, agency, memory) are original contributions
- [ ] Exercise progression follows our pedagogical logic, not Walsh's structure
- [ ] Examples consistently serve humanities questions rather than technical demonstration

  - Students analyze their own social media language patterns
  - Focus on what algorithms might infer about them
  - Connect to privacy and digital identity themes

#### **Tutorial Prerequisites Rewrite** (Priority 1)

#### **CodeAlong Content Review** (Priority 2)
- [ ] Audit Variables_DataTypes notebook for Walsh parallels
- [ ] Replace generic examples with culturally relevant scenarios
- [ ] Ensure progression serves digital humanities goals

### **Medium-term Development**

#### **Exercise Framework Replacement** (Weeks 1-4)

- [ ] Week 2: "The Sorting Algorithm" (lists/loops as social classification)
- [ ] Week 3: "Digital Archaeology" (file I/O as cultural excavation)  
- [ ] Week 4: "Data Stories" (visualization as cultural argument)

#### **Assessment Rubric Development**
- [ ] Create rubrics emphasizing cultural insight over technical proficiency
- [ ] Design peer review processes for collaborative critical thinking
- [ ] Develop reflection prompts connecting technical skills to broader questions
